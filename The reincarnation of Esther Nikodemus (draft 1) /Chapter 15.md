# Chapter 15

Two lessons in noble behaviour took up the day for the rest of the week. The duke had gotten fed up with how I behaved like a commoner and suggested to my parents that a tutor would give me the fundamentals. My father was reluctant to agree at first, but mother took my side when I told her that it looked fun and interesting. And it was. 

Karrie took me to see a play once. The story was about how a disgraced noble lady, a villainess they called her, had been framed for a crime she didn’t commit and was put to the guillotine for it. The way the actors moved and behaved had put me in a trance as I stared at them perform. Even more impressive was that the way they acted was just like how my parents acted. Seeing them move around in this estate was like watching my own private play.

I had been excited at first, no longer would there be nothing to do while I waited for the next meal. The duke would give me permission to access the library if I would show results by a week. My tutor was an older woman who looked like a bird. Her eyes were narrow and the shape of her face made it look like she constantly pushed in her cheeks. It looked familiar. 

The first lesson started with an insult. With that single sentence, my interest and motivation left my body like the wind. I had been quite proud of my curtsy as my mom was the one who taught me. She began pointing out every flaw as I curtsied over and over and over again. Never would I have thought that lifting my skirt would be such a tiring thing to do. My hand even began to cramp. 

The second lesson went horribly. My tutor or not, who was she to use the dinner plates as she wished. Even the maid fidgeted awkwardly as she stood there with a cart full of them. I tried to catch the falling plate from my head by reflex, but it was my left hand. The pain I felt as the edge of the plate lodged itself into my disfigured finger joints made my mind go blank. Then the plate fell and broke into pieces anyway. 

It was absurd. The whole thing had been absurd. Why did it have to be a plate of all things that I had to balance on my head? I didn’t get it. 

After that day, the lessons got even more absurd and physically demanding. Stand still while taking a barrage of insults. Walk backwards with a cup on my head this time. And sit still without doing but smile. There had to be something wrong with the lessons. I decided to kill her on the seventh day.  

She had been noticing that the fingers on my left hand were weak and demanded that I remove my glove. 

“I don’t think my glove has anything to do with this lesson, Baroness Bayonne.”

We were doing the ‘pour scalding hot water into the tea cup and then back again’ exercise. 

“Remove it, you won't be able to pinpoint the optimal temperature otherwise. Besides, gloves make you look older than you are.” I glanced at her wrinkled fingers. 

“Do it or I will report to the Duke of your truancy.”

I took off my glove and showed her. She looked shocked. As expected. 

“Oh my goddess\! What a hideous sight, put on your gloves again quickly\!”

It was then that I remembered. The first person I had ever killed showed the same expression as this woman. Is this your doing too Goddess? Why do the ones I killed keep appearing in front of me? If that is how you are going to do things, then let's give you a test.

Holding my lucky coin, I flipped it into the air. Heads, I kill her. Tails, I let her go in this life. The coin flipped a few times before falling on my palm. It was tails. However something about the way it flipped bothered me. Another flip, another tails. I will kill her if its tails again, I thought to myself before giving it another flip. Heads this time. I flipped the coin again and again, but no matter how many times. It wouldn’t give me the side I wanted. I couldn’t help but laugh as it showed tails twelve times in a row. 

But how would I go about killing her? The goddess wouldn't let me kill her. She wouldn’t let me kill anything for that matter. A fly buzzed around my room a few days ago. Smacking it had no effect as I saw the thing fly away. It was now laying dead in the box I trapped it in. 

There was no lesson today, meaning no Baroness Bayonne to torment me. 

“Young lady, is something the matter?”

A maid stood in the hall busily dusting away the countless decorations. It was a vase with yellow flowers. 

“Do you want some candy?” 

This maid occasionally gave me candy and was the same maid as the one who had been witness to the plate incident. Her hair was braided in a ponytail that fluttered in the air as she turned. It was a strawberry flavored candy.

“Thank you.”

“You don't need to thank me, my lady. Just seeing you happy is enough for us.”

“What do you mean?”

“The house has been much livelier ever since you became a guest, you know.” She was smiling. 

“It’s a shame that the baroness is so strict. She’s not asking you to do something unreasonable is she?”

“I don’t think so.”

“Well, if she ever does, know that we are on your side young lady.” The maid thumped her chest.  

\*\*\*  
“My if it isn’t little miss Esther\! Are you here for snacks again? Sorry but I already promised your mother not to give you too many.” The cook handed me a cookie with a wink. It tasted like butter today. 

The kitchen was always busy with people flying around. The smell here made my mouth water. 

“What are you making today?”

“Hmm, we got a prime cut of deer today. Pair that up with some wine to make a demi-glace and mushrooms and there you have it. How does that sound?”

“Sounds amazing.”

“Haha\! You always have the best compliments.”

“Can you make my plate have fewer mushrooms this time too?”

“Will do little miss.” 

\*\*\*  
“Well if it isn't Esther, what brings you here to this old man today?” The gardener went down the ladder when he saw me stand in the forest-like garden. 

“Mr gardener, do you know of any secluded spots in the garden?”

“Secluded you say? Are you playing hide and seek with the maids outside today?” I nodded.

“Well there is the area behind the annex, the shed, oh. Maybe the abandoned church would be a good hiding place?

“There’s an abandoned church here?”

“Sure is, it's over there. Be careful not to trip on the roots okay?”

I hopped around the forest at the back of the estate. Sure enough, there it was, a gray building where vines had taken over. It smelled like moss and dust as I entered the open front door. The statue stood at the top of the broken altar, vines had climbed all over it, flowers dotting its roots. Even in that state she looked to be happy, smiling like an idiot. 

Sitting in one of the usable benches all there was to hear was the wind. It flowed gently through the missing bricks in the wall and rustled the overgrown grass. A single ray of sun shined front the roof onto the statue almost like it was intended for the hole to be there. I found myself sitting for a while longer before my mother came to find me. 

“What are you doing here, Esther?”

“Nothing.”

“Does the statue of the Goddess still make you feel uneasy?”

“How did you know?” I never told her?

“You’re my daughter are you not? I know everything.” I wonder if I would have been irritated if they made a statue of my mom instead. 

“Really? What else do you know?”

“I also know that you ate some snacks before dinner.”

“Amazing.” She wasn’t bluffing.

“Why don’t we go back? It’s a bit chilly here.”

I took a final glance at the place before holding my mom’s hand. This place would do. I stuck my tongue at the dumb piece of marble.

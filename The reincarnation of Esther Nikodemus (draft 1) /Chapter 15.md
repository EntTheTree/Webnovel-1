# Chapter 15

My uncle and aunt had arrived this morning in their carriages. The Nikodemus crest had a picture of a black rose, a color that was used often in the estate. I liked black, it didn’t hurt my eyes and it felt cozy. A shame that it was a flower being displayed on the crest. The carriages under the window had different crests. My uncle and his family got out of the blue rose carriage and my aunt and her two children got out of the green one. 

“When will your husband arrive?” The duke asked. 

My aunt dabbed her mouth with a napkin. “Who knows?”

We were currently having dinner together. My grandfather sat at the end like always, the firstborn and his wife occupied the seats to his right, while the secondborn took the seat to the left. My father sat beside my aunt and my mother sat opposite of him. Us children had been seated on the rest of the seats accordingly. The first time I saw this table, I thought it to be unnecessarily long. Yet seeing all the seats being used made it look rather small today. My grandmother didn’t attend today’s dinner.

“My dear sister, you shouldn’t answer our father like that”, my uncle said. “He must be running late with his business again, father.”

“What would you know about my husband, Gilbert?”

My uncle, Gilbert Nikodemus had a pleasant appearance. His eyes were a bit rounder than my father’s and the way they tilted downward to the sides, made him appear to constantly have a smiling expression. He looked friendly enough. 

“Many would know about your husband, Grace.” My aunt clicked her tongue. 

The first impression I got from my aunt was that she looked like a fox. She stood half a head taller than my mother, making her fox-like eyes stare downwards when we went to greet her. I noticed that she was frowning.

“That’s enough.” My grandfather let out a sigh.

“Your Grace, you shouldn’t sigh that much, it will dry out your happiness.” Uncle’s wife mirrored his expression. My grandfather let out another sigh.

“Where is mother? I haven’t seen her in a while.”

“We will talk about that after dinner.”

“Is that why you had us all called here?” My aunt asked. “You even managed to find Galen.“ All the heads at the table turned to my father. 

“Speaking of which, why are they sitting at our table?” My father stopped cutting the piece of meat on his plate

“The Duke has so graciously invited me into his home, which makes me an honorable guest.”

“Is she also an honorable guest?” My aunt pointed at my mother with her knife. “I can’t believe you have the nerve to show your face back here.” The droplets on the knife dripped as she bounced it up and down. 

“Grace”, the Duke said.

“I can’t believe it.” She stood up. “I’ve lost my appetite, please excuse me.” Her sharp heels clacked as she left the room. I wanted to see how my mom was doing, but it was too far to get a look, we sat on the same side at the table. I only saw how the expressions of the other side looked. I felt a silent need to wipe their faces.

“She comes and goes as she pleases like always”, my other aunt said. “I pity her husband for having to control such a woman.”

“Don’t say that, dear. It’s an honor to be able to wed into our family. My sister is just tired from the long journey is all. Isn’t that right, father?”

My own father put down his knife and fork. “If it is such an honor, then why is he not here with us then? What you are saying is not making sense, Lord Gilbert.”

“I was not asking for your opinion on this matter, Galen.” 

“Stop the squabbling, I’m getting a headache just hearing you all speak.”

“Alden, take the children out of here and serve them dessert or whatever children like.”

The servants began taking our plates and ushered us out. Luckily I had gotten to eat something before I lost my appetite. It didn’t taste that good today. 

I followed my cousins as we were led to another room. The pair of brothers took a seat at the couch as if it was natural. 

I followed my cousins as we were led to another room. I didn’t know exactly what had happened but watching the older ones calmly take a seat on the couch I thought no more of it.

“Hah… This always happens when we all get together.” One of the brothers slumped on the couch. 

“At least the food always tastes good”, said the older one.

My youngest cousin hadn’t taken a seat yet. She stood staring at me with her big round eyes. Her hair was styled into twintails which were adorned by green ribbons. 

“Hello\! I’m Leah. Who are you?”, she asked with a bounce.

“My name is Esther. I’m fourteen.” I didn’t know whether I had to or not but I gave her a curtsy anyway.”

“Wow\! You’re the same age as my big sister, your names sound the same too\! Estelle and Esther\!” She bounced up and down excitedly.

“Leah, you shouldn’t talk to her.”

“Why not?” she asked her sister.

“You see that yellow hair? That’s because she’s a witch”. She smirked at me.

My hands twitched. What did she mean by that?  “I’m not a witch.” 

“Your mother is a witch, which makes you a witch too.” I felt my blood turn. I get that she could not like me, but calling my mom a witch was unacceptable. 

“My mother is not a witch, please take that back.”

“Why should I? It’s the truth isn't it?” She turned to the brothers. I felt my body begin to heat up and a prickling sensation grazed my back. 

“You two figure it out yourself, don’t drag me into your childish arguments.”

“A witch? What did she do?” I heard the other one say.

“I don’t know, why don't we go ask her mother?”

My body felt like it was burning. The prickling sensation had multiplied, it felt like needles were digging into my skin. Who were they to disrespect my mother like this? I forced my hands to stay still. 

“Why are you saying this? My mother is a good person.” Why did I always have to defend my mother from strangers? 

“A good person? As if\!” She laughed. I could tell she hated me by the way her eyes glared at me. I had seen it all too often. 

“It’s your mother’s fault that my mother is always sad\!” 

I had to get out of here. A second more and I would not be able to stop myself. I ran away. 

“I’m not finished talking to you\!”

Someone was saying something but I ignored them. I ran across the carpet. I entered my room. I opened the window. I took off my gloves. My body was getting unbearably hot. I wanted to rip my skin off.

“Miss, are you all right?” 

What? What was she doing in here? Did she see my hand? The rough wall behind me stopped me when I staggered backwards. I saw her feet standing in front of the door frame in my room. She stood in front of my door. 

“Get out.”

“You don’t look well…”

“I said get out\!” She turned around and went to the door. Then she closed it.

“What are you doing?”

“Just pretend I’m not here.” She was facing the closed door.

“I am a guest of the Duke, get out of my room\!”

“...”

My back itched, my chest itched, my face itched. Fine, just stand there all you want.   
I began digging into my neck, scratching where it itched. The cool wind gave me relief as it grazed where the skin was exposed. I trembled, it looked disgusting in the mirror. The reflection stood hunched over. My hair was undone, it was messy. Mom had braided it for me that morning.

The maid was quiet as a mouse standing there while I felt my body cool down. Her back was turned to me making it impossible to see her face. She had light blue hair which was braided to the left.

“You can turn around now…” 

She did as I told her and I finally saw her face, it was the maid from yesterday. She looked concerned. 

“Why did you enter my room without permission”

“I saw you run away with a terrible expression on your face.”

“What does that matter to you?”

“It matters a great deal miss”

What was this maid saying? 

“It may not be my place but let me say this: your mother is not a witch.”

“I know that already, there is no way she is a witch. They don’t even exist anyway.”

The maid walked closer to me. “Here are your gloves”

“You’re not disgusted by them?”

“It’s not my place to judge our guests.”

“You do a lot of things for acting so servile.”

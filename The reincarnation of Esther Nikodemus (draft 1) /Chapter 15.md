# Chapter 15

This morning, the servants were busy with preparing for the arrival of the Duke’s children. I was learning some more noble etiquette from my mom when I asked her how to act and behave in front of them. She told me to not worry. They won’t even look or talk to us. Mom’s comment didn’t exactly make me understand but seeing them walk with a noble air around, I understood. These were real, proud and confident nobles.  
   
Although I had learnt how to act like a noble by observing my parents and my grandparents, there was something different about them. They marched in the entrance with a confident gait while the servants took care of their luggage. The first first family to arrive was my uncle. A carriage bearing the family crest, a rose, was stationed out in the driveway. Different from the Nikodemus crest was the color. Instead of the usual black, it was blue instead. There was a blue rose painted on the carriage.  
   
My uncle had a friendly appearance. The end of his eyes drooped downwards to the sides, making him appear to always be smiling about something. His wife looked dazzling, literally. A necklace with countless gems fitted into it, earrings that seemed far too big and I could swear I saw diamonds sewed onto her dress. It was sparkling whenever she took a step. Imagine how many silvers her outfit would cost. 

The next to arrive was my aunt. Her carriage sported a green rose this time. Why was the family crest a rose of all things, couldn’t there be an animal or a sword at least? I could already feel my irritation brew as a striking woman entered through the door. She was a fox. At the temple there were some foxes living in the surrounding forest. They had an air of mystique about them, pretty too. One of these had once wandered up to me, staring me in the eyes. It looked angry. 

Her clacking high heels went silent when she stopped in front of my mom giving a curtsy. Even if we were the guests of the Duke himself, proper etiquette had to be observed. We couldn’t lift our heads until told by a higher ranking person. This was one of the things that I didn’t like about noble etiquette. My grandmother didn’t care much about it, but there were so many rules and proper ways to do things. Dinner etiquette had been easy because it was logical, but the things I learnt were more akin to nonsense. My aunt stood there for a while before clicking her tongue and strutting away, her two daughters in tow. My mom looked exhausted already. 

“When will your husband arrive?” The Duke cut into his steak.

My fox-like aunt dabbed her mouth with a napkin before answering. “Who knows?”

My grandfather sat at the end like always with his firstborn son to his right and his daughter to the left. Their family trickled downwards before ending up at the end where my parents and I sat. The first time I saw this table, I thought it to be unnecessarily long. Yet seeing all the seats filled it looked rather small today. My grandmother didn’t attend today’s dinner.

“My dear sister, you shouldn’t answer our father like that”, my uncle said. “He must be running late with his business again, father.”

“What would you know about my husband, Gilbert?”

“Many would know about your husband, Grace.” It was too far to discern the look on my aunt’s face, but the big gulp of wine she drank gave me a rough idea.

“That’s enough”. The Duke let out a sigh.

“Your Grace, you shouldn’t sigh that much. I heard a little happiness disappears each time\!” My uncle’s wife chirped. I heard another sigh leak out.

“Where is mother? Is she not well today too?” Uncle Gilbert asked. 

“We will talk about that matter after dinner.”

Aunt Grace took another swig of wine. “Is that why you had us all called here? You even managed to find Galen.” It was audible when they all turned their heads towards my father.

“And why is it that they are sitting at our table?” 

“The Duke had graciously extended an invitation to us, which makes us honorable guests deserving to sit here.”

“Hah, does that mean she is also an honorable guest?” She pointed her knife at my mom. “I can’t believe you have the nerve to show your face back here and even to deign to sit with us.” The bloody droplets dripped as she bounced it up and down. What did my mom do to experience such animosity?

“Grace”, the Duke called her name.

“I can’t believe it.” She stood up. “I’ve lost my appetite, please excuse me.” Her sharp heels clacked as she left. Her children didn’t even react to this breach of conduct, as if it was a common occurrence. I looked at my mom’s face but she still had that smile she taught me. That smile didn’t fit her.

“She comes and goes like the storm that one”, my other aunt said. “I can’t imagine how her husband must feel.”

“Don’t say that, dear. It’s an honor to be able to wed into our family. My sister must just be tired from the long journey is all. Isn’t that right, father?”

My father put down his fork. “If it is such an honor, then why is he not here with us then? The duke personally invited him after all. What you are saying is not making sense, Lord Gilbert.”

“Oh, did I ask for your opinion by mistake? Galen.”

“Stop it, I’m getting a headache just hearing you all speak.”

The rest of the dinner was as silent as the grave. Only the occasional clatter of silver hitting porcelain could be heard. The adults had gone off to meet my grandmother making us children the only ones left sitting in the adjoining tea room. 

This was my first time seeing noble children and my imagination had been too much. They looked just like normal children. The brothers were busy playing cards and calling each other things like: you suck, you’re bad, and I will win next time. The older sister was reading a book while sitting with a straight back and in front of me stood the younger one. Her hair was styled into twintails, a green ribbon adorning each of the tails. Her round eyes were staring at me.

“Hello\! I’m Leah. Who are you?”

“Hello, my name is Esther.” 

“You’re really pretty\! How old are you?”

“I’m fourteen this year.”

“Wow\! You’re the same as my big sister, your names sound the same too\! Estelle and Esther\!” She bounced up and down excitedly.

“Do you want to play with me? My sister is always reading or doing boring stuff…”

“If you will allow me”

She giggled. “You talk just like an old lady\!” 

We were playing with a piece of string. It was surprisingly fun. Making new shapes as it wrapped around my fingers as I tried to copy what she did. I couldn’t do the more complex shapes because of my stiff left hand. 

“You.” Estelle was standing in front of us. 

“What month is your birthday?” Is this how noble children greeted each other? I didn’t have enough reference to know.

“It was in February.” 

She smirked. “Mine’s in January”.

A monk once said that children have a tendency to follow in their parent’s footsteps, good or bad. I had vehemently denied that theory, but as to mock me. Cases where it supported his theory kept popping up. If her mother was a fox, then she would be a cat. She had long straight hair with a green accessory in her hair. Her eyes looked at me like that of a predator looking at prey. The way she crossed her arms and tilted her hip made me unreasonably irritated. I could tell she was looking down on me. 

“What did you think about Alcove’s Exhaltations?”

“I have not read that.” The library only permitted family members to enter, making me only stand outside the door and glare at the bookkeeper who always sat in his seat. Nonetheless, even if I had gotten access, a book titled Exaltations sounded nonsensical. Who could be so happy as to write a book about it? 

“So you haven’t come that far yet, what about The journey of Deborah?” Why was she looking so proud?

“Oh, I liked that one\!” Leah nodded. I could only shake my head.

“What? Not even that one?” 

She continued to mention book titles, almost like expecting me to at least have read at least one of them.

“The monster encyclopedia?”

“Oh, that I’ve read.”

“Hey“, she called out. “Who’s your tutor? Yours doesn't sound good. Mine was countess Belford.” My finger twitched.

“I don’t have a tutor.”

“You don’t have a tutor? Everyone has a tutor. Where did you learn etiquette then?” What was with all these questions? It was like how that detective had questioned me. “You are better than those dull boys over there.”

“I learnt from my mother”

Her eyes went wide. “That woman? You’re lying.” Why was she calling my mother ‘that woman’? 

“I’m not lying and her name is Victoria.” I couldn’t even lie if my life depended on it. 

“Why should I know her name? She’s not even a noble.” She poked my forehead. “I heard that woman is just a commoner.” Poke, poke. “A lowly orphan servant commoner.” 

I wanted to kill her right there and then.

\*\*\*  
I found myself back in my room when I came back to. My gloves sat on the table in front of me letting the sun warm up my hands. The light rippled as it hit my left hand casting waves of shadows across the skin. I tried to forget the incident where I got caught, but just like the morning sun. The icing pain reminded me every single day that I had failed that day. Killing wasn’t something I particularly enjoyed, I did it out of necessity. 

I still remember the first time I did it. It was some old woman sleeping on the ground. Everyday on the same spot, at the same time and every time I walked from the house, she slept there. On that piece of tattered cardboard. There was one day when she didn’t sleep there. A miracle I thought. No more would I have to see her dirty clothes and that dirty paper cup staining my view. Alas, the very next day she was back again. Still sleeping and still dirty. That was when I couldn’t take it any longer. I wanted her gone.

My trip from the house got remarkably better after that day. Sure, her shocked expression as I jammed a knife in her throat still surfaced whenever I slept or ate or studied or went to the toilet, but that was for better than seeing her sorry state at the corner of the street. 

A week after my first murder, Ann suddenly pulled me to the side. To ask me something.

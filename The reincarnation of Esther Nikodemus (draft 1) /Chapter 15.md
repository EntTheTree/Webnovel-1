# Chapter 15

My uncle and aunt had arrived this morning in their carriages. The Nikodemus crest had a picture of a black rose, a color that was used often in the estate. I liked black, it didn’t hurt my eyes and it felt cozy. A shame that it was a flower being displayed on the crest. The carriages under the window had different crests. My uncle and his family got out of the blue rose carriage and my aunt and her two children got out of the green one. 

“When will your husband arrive?” The duke asked. 

My aunt dabbed her mouth with a napkin. “Who knows?”

We were currently having dinner together. My grandfather sat at the end like always, the firstborn and his wife occupied the seats to his right, while the secondborn took the seat to the left. My father sat beside my aunt and my mother sat opposite of him. Us children had been seated on the rest of the seats accordingly. The first time I saw this table, I thought it to be unnecessarily long. Yet seeing all the seats being used made it look rather small today. My grandmother didn’t attend today’s dinner.

“My dear sister, you shouldn’t answer our father like that”, my uncle said. “He must be running late with his business again, father.”

“What would you know about my husband, Gilbert?”

My uncle, Gilbert Nikodemus had a pleasant appearance. His eyes were a bit rounder than my father’s and the way they tilted downward to the sides, made him appear to constantly have a smiling expression. He looked friendly enough. 

“Many would know about your husband, Grace.” My aunt clicked her tongue. 

The first impression I got from my aunt was that she looked like a fox. She stood half a head taller than my mother, making her fox-like eyes stare downwards when we went to greet her. I noticed that she was frowning.

“That’s enough.” My grandfather let out a sigh.

“Your Grace, you shouldn’t sigh that much, it will dry out your happiness.” Uncle’s wife mirrored his expression. My grandfather let out another sigh.

“Where is mother? I haven’t seen her in a while.”

“We will talk about that after dinner.”

“Is that why you had us all called here?” My aunt asked. “You even managed to find Galen.“ Everyone at the table turned their head to my father. His hands continued to cut the slab of meat on his plate.

“I said we will talk about it after dinner.”

“Fine, do as you wish.” My aunt stood up. “You finish your meal, children. Your mother is tired.” Her two daughters gave an affirmative nod.

Dessert wasn’t served today, a fact that would normally leave me disappointed. The adults had gone into the Duke’s office to speak about some important matter. 

The maids and servants began to clean our plates 

Her two daughters in front of me gave an affirmative nod. One looked to be my age and the other far younger. They were whispering to each other.   
“Estelle, mom got tired really fast today.” 

“It must be because of them.”

“You mean her? She’s pretty\!” 

She turned her head. “Hey, what's your name, I’m Leah\!” The girl with twintails had a big smile on her face. 

“My name is Esther, I’m fourteen.” 

“Wow\! You’re the same age as my big sister, your names sound the same too\! Estelle and Esther." She bounced excitedly up and down, making her hair fly around. 

“Don’t get too close to her.”

“Why not?”

Estelle smirked. “Because her mother is a witch” 

My hands twitched. What did she mean by that? Lifting my head I saw four pairs of eyes looking at me. 

I felt my body begin to heat up and a prickling sensation grazed my back. 

“A witch? What did she do?” I heard a boyish voice ask.

“Brother, don’t join them.”

“Tsk, you’re so boring.” 

My body felt like it was burning. The prickling sensation had multiplied, it felt like needles were digging into my skin. Why did they call my mother a witch? I had to avert my gaze from their accusationary glares. 

“Hey”, I saw her twintails move. “Are you a witch too?”

Stars were beginning to pop up as my peripheral vision darkened. 

I forced my hands to stay still and it made them tremble.   
My hands wanted to move, but I forced them to stay still. They wanted to scratch the itchiness. I hid my 

I had to get out of here. The Duke’s plate still had pieces of food on it, but I had to get out now. I wanted to rip my back off, I wanted to freeze myself in icy water. My aunt left the table, I could also leave right?  

“Your Grace, it seems Esther is unwell, could she be excused?” My mom spoke. 

“Of course.”

I stood up, someone was saying something as my legs walked out the door. I ran across the carpet. I entered my room. I opened the window. I took off my gloves.

“Miss, are you all right?” 

What? What was she doing in here? Did she see my hand? The rough wall behind me stopped me when I staggered backwards. The maid from yesterday stood in front of my door. She looked concerned.

“Get out.”

“You don’t look well…”

“I said get out\!” She turned around and went to the door. Then she closed it.

“What are you doing?”

“Just pretend I’m not here.” She was facing the closed door.

“I am a guest of the Duke, get out of my room\!”

“...”

My back itched, my chest itched, my face itched. Fine, just stand there all you want.   
I began digging into my neck, scratching where it itched. The cool wind gave me relief as it grazed where the skin was exposed. I trembled, it looked disgusting in the mirror. The reflection stood hunched over. My hair was undone, it was messy. Mom had braided it for me that morning.

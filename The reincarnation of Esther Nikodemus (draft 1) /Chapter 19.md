# Chapter 19

TK flashback or temple scene. maybe talk about ghosts, the kind that latches on the mind.

“Have you ever seen a ghost before?” 

“I don’t believe in ghosts.”

“Why not?” The monk had brewed some pu-erh tea, it looked brown and smelled like fish. I’d rather have plain green tea over this.

“We all have four ghosts hovering above us you know?”

“What? You have killed four people?”

“Ha ha\! I didn’t mean it like that.” His round belly shook from the laughter. 

“Each person has four ghosts attached to them. One, the ghost of attachment. This one affects our wants. Two, the ghost of idk. Three, the ghost of idk. And four, the ghost of idk.”

“How about it, makes sense right?”

“Not really.” I thought of my mom, what ghost had taken over her?

“Then what about real ghosts?”

“Those exist too of course”, he smiled. “Why do you think food is always offered on the altar?”

Victoria and Gale watched as their daughter collapsed from her crying. 

Victoria and Gale watched their daughter collapse from her wailing. They had initially intended to only ask her why she was gone from her room that night, but emotions were hard to predict and Victoria’s had reached it peak. How could she maintain her cool when her daughter came back covered in soot and ash. What was she even doing there?

However none of that concerned them. Esther had told them something nonsensical between her sobs. Sobs which had come out of nowhere. Victoria hadn’t even begun her tirade when their daughter’s body suddenly trembled and fell to her knees. She said she was sorry, but why? Esther had always been the apple of their eye. Holding his limp daughter in his arms, Gale thought she weighed too little. Add onto that her past history of illnesses, and they couldn’t help but love their pity daughter. She had never complained, not even a grumble and always did what they told her. It had continued even after she lost her memories.

A part of her nature, they thought. However, seeing the terrified face when Victoria scolded her, they knew that something was wrong. Oh Goddess\! Whatever did our daughter do to deserve this? She recalled that time when Esther had screamed and cried in front of the Goddess. It was the first time she saw Esther behave like that. It wasn’t normal.

Victoria stroked her sleeping daughter’s hair. Small bits of ash and burnt bits were stuck in her hair, eventually staining her own hand. A seed of guilt grew in her as she plucked all the dirty bits from her hair. There had been no need to scold her, she was smart enough to know the dangers of fire. Still she had to, just this once. And the result was this. 

She felt her shoulders warm up as Gale draped his coat around her. 

“What do you think she meant?” She grasped her husband hand on her shoulder.

“I’m not sure, but she didn’t look to be in the right state of mind.”

“What happened in Barre and now this… I can’t help but worry, Gale.”

“I know.”

“She’s still just a girl. So much has already happened to her.”

“We just have to do what we always do.”

“What if she loses her memory again? She had just begun to look happier…”

“Let’s not think about it anymore. We just need to care for her like always.”

“You’re right…”

Gale stood and watched his wife watch over their sleeping daughter. He had thought himself lucky to have such a beutiful family, but it seemed like the world had turned agaisnt them. He had been shocked when Esther told him that she didn’t like the statues of the Goddesses. It was a blaspheme comment coming from his own daugher, however he couldn’t help but agree. If the goddess was as benevolent as they said, why didn’t she once show our daughter a ounce of it? Victoria had nodded off sleeping in the chair again. It seemed she slept better this way.

My body ached. I didn’t die again did I? Good, my left hand still looked disgusting. Yesterday felt like a daze, only one thing had remained in my memories. The baroness was no more. 

My sleeping mom’s visage greeted me as I struggled to sit up. It seems like I had done it again. My teeth bit into my lip as I had broken one of my own promises, that I would never worry her again. Sliding my legs out of the bed, I felt the smooth grain of the wooden planks underneath my feet. It robbed me of the remaining warmth in my body. A loud thump sounded as I stood up.

I collapsed onto the floor? “Huh?” 

“Hmm…” My mother stirred to life as her towering figure stretched towards the heavens. My body flinched for some reason. 

“Oh\! What are you doing on the floor?” Her blanket flew off as she raced toward me. I felt my body lift up as she pulled me back onto the bed. I sat on the edge of the bed looking up at her.

“Mom, did you get stronger?” 

“Your mom is always strong you know?” Her smile was gentle as always. 

“Where’s father?”

“Do you want me to go fetch him?”

“No, its okay… What happened to the fire?”

“We managed to extinquish it, the rain helped us a lot that day.”

“What about the church?”

“We had to demolish it.”

“I see.” The sun had painted the room in a light hue, making things look brighter than ever  today.

“You should probably wash up, it’s been a few days.”

“Days?” What did she mean by that."

“Oh, you have been in bed for the past three days. Don’t you remember?”

Something was gripping my heart. I didn’t know what it was, but it hurt. It hurt really bad.

TK make mc visit the people she met before the fire.

“Good morning miss\! How are you feeling today?”

“Good morning, I feel fine.”

“Haa… its never fine when people say they are fine. Want a candy?”

“Really? Oh, it’s lemon today.”

“Miss, you shouldn’t trust her too much.” She whispered. “She hates lemon.”

“Ah\! How could you say that in front of our adorable miss\!”

The TKnoncandymaid shrugged. “Just saying the truth is all.”

“Speaking of which, did you hear what happened to the baroness?” My ears turned to her direction. “I heard someone say that she ran away\! Not only that, but she had apperantly stolen a bunch of stuff too\!”

What? She ran away? That didn’t make sense. 

“That’s right, TK”

“Good to see you up and active again little miss. Had us for a second when there\!” The cook laughed heartily. He handed me a cookie.

“I thought mom stopped you from giving me snacks.”

“Well… That’s right. You haven’t eaten anything the last days, think of it as a loan.”

Nibbling on the cookie, sweet crumbs filled my mouth. It’s velvety texture and— Wait that wasn’t important right now.

“The baroness? Don’t even mention her. Look.” He pulled out his necklace for me to see.

“Who would have thought that she was the thief? Ridiculous, and they are the ones that keep saying that nobles are different than us commoners. Oh, we have nothing agaisnt you miss.”

The gardener was cleaning up the burnt area with a shovel. “I knew I didn’t like her the moment I saw her, and once again my intuition was right. But who would have known that a person getting through the Duke’s screening would resort to such actions? Where she ran away to? I’m afraid that I don’t know that. She must have been an expert to disapper in the wind like that.

Everyone was saying the same thing, that she had run away. It didn’t make sense. The burnt grass let out crunches and crackles as I stepped on them. The whole area was burnt, not a single flower was to be seen.

The already shabby-looking church now looked even worse. The roof had disappered leaving only the walls to indicitate that it was a building. 

It was gone. Where my feet were standing, her body should have been here, but it was gone. I had half-expected a chalk outline outlining her burnt corpse. It didn’t make sense. I saw the fire burn into her skin and bones, I even smelled it. There’s no way she could have survived that.

“Did you do this?” How I wished that she would have burned down too. It just had to be made out of rocks.

“What are you looking sad for? I should be the one being sad\!” The nerve on that goddess. You foiled my plans again and have the gall to cry?”

“Stop getting in my way\!”

A voice called out my name. 

“F-father?” Did he hear me? “What are you doing here?”

“That’s what I should be asking you.” His eyes made my neck hairs rise.

“I can’t believe you returned back here even after what happened.”

My throat began to clog up. 

“Esther, I know what you tried to do. Unfortunately it failed.”

Would I have to run away?

“What do you mean?” Did I fail to clean up again? Was it too suspicous that I was at the site of the accident? A bunch of questions flooded my mind as I saw my father walk closer. I couldn’t move. 

“Esther.” He grabbed my shoulder.

“I’m sorry that the baroness couldn’t be saved. You must have felt devastated.”

“Huh?”

His face wall full of concern as the corners of his eyes shrunk into themselves. 

“It’s okay, you did your best.”

My father hugged me. Thank the goddess that he couldn’t see my face in this moment.

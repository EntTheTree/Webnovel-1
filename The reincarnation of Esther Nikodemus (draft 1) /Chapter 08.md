# Chapter 8: Why

“Honey, wake up”

“Hmm?” I felt my body shake.

“Gale get up.”

“What is it?” Five more minutes…

Smack\! My face got slapped.

“Galen Nikodemus\!”

“Wh-what is it?” 

“I can’t find Esther\!” Victoria seemed about to cry.

“What do you mean, isn’t she in bed?”

“She isn't\!" She was panicking.

I leapt out of bed, running to my daughters room. It was empty.

“Esther\!” Victoria ran around, throwing open the other doors, checking whether she was there or not.

“Victoria”, I called out to her.

“Esther\! Please come out\!”

“Victoria\!” Shaking her by the shoulders, she finally looked at me.

“She’s not here”

“What do you mean?” She stared blankly.

“I can’t sense her with my mana”

Victoria went quiet. Her shoulders fell.

“Can you find her?”

“Don’t worry”, I began packing up my gear, “I will find her no matter what.”

After ensuring that our vicinity was safe, I led Victoria to our neighbors. They were shocked at hearing that Esther was gone. I asked them to look after my wife in case something happened and they ushered her in without thought. They really were a great pair.

I closed my eyes and began focusing my mana whirling in my body. I had occasionally practiced mana control, it was routine by now, but it felt extra hard to control it today. I had to calm my mind. The mana began collecting into my eyes, making them feel warm to the touch. Slowly the world lit up. The faint glow of five mana trails could be seen. Four of them were seeping into the house but a fifth, golden trail could be seen heading toward the town. Esther, where did you go in the middle of the night? 

I began sprinting, the moon at my back.

\*\*\*  
“Stop\!” My little finger was crushed.

“Stop it\!” The hammer had hit the base of my finger.

“Why should I?” The man stared at me. “You tried killing my son\!” He changed out the flower, laying it on the table before me. A fresh flower was put under my bloodied hand. The finger looked disgusting. The outer flesh had been ripped, muscle peeing from underneath. 

“Ahhh\!” The hammer crushed another one of my fingers. Painting another rose.

“No one touches my son without my permission\!”

Why, why why why.

“Shhhh, don’t cry little girl.” He put his hand on my head. “The goddess will welcome you with open arms\!”

The goddess?

“You know that right?” He changed the flowers. There were two red roses staring at me. 

“Huh?”

“Tsk, you still don’t get it.” He raised his hammer again. 

I don’t get it, why was I reincarnated? Why did I get to remember my previous life? I don’t get it.

“I’m doing this for you\!”

My shriek filled the room as my middle finger got crushed. The hammer clattered to the floor. 

“That should be enough for today’s harvest. I can’t send a sweet girl like you all beaten up\!” 

He went to the wall. *I don’t want to get hurt.* He picked up a knife. *I just want to eat tasty food.* He took a step closer. *I just want Victoria to give me another hug.* 

“Mom…” I really don’t want to die again.

“Don’t you worry”, he raised his knife, “you will be able to meet her soon”

I’m sorry mom. I can’t stop crying. I promise I will stop. Please forgive me.

The knife flew towards my neck stabbing into it. I closed my eyes. 

“What?” Something poked my neck and a bright light shone through my eyelids.

A thud hit the ground below my legs. Wrenching my teary eyes open, I saw the knife laying there, the hand still gripping it.

“You bastard\!”

The owner of the hand flew across the room, smashing into the wall of tools. Gale was standing there sword in hand. My dad had arrived.

“You dare touch my daughter\!” The blade flew through the air, slicing off another hand. I couldn’t even see the sword’s shadow.

“My hands\!” He let out a roar.

“Shut your mouth\!” His head flew backwards, a few teeth fell to the ground, upon smashing into my dad’s boot.

“S-shtop\!”

Dad slashed his sword. The left leg got severed.

“W-wait\!”

Another slash, another leg.

“You bastard\! Do you know who I-”

“You goddamn demon\!”

The blade sliced cleanly through his neck sending his head flying. Rolling on the dirty floor, his eyes were still open.

“Esther\!” He turned toward me. Blood had spattered all over his clothes and face. But I didn’t mind.

“Oh my goddess, let me get you out of here.” He began untying my hands and legs.

“Dad…”

“Yes, your dad is here, I’m here.

“It hurts…”

“You’re fine, don’t you worry”. He picked me up into his arms.

“I thought I was going to die…”

“You’re not going to die, I’m here. Shh.”

“I don’t want to die\!” I dug my face into his arms.

\*\*\*  
The incident threw the whole town into chaos. The captain of the guards had died, his body displayed in the middle of town square for all to see, his limbs stacked like bricks on his body. The townspeople started protesting, demanding the capture of the Executioner. The Baron, now without his trusted captain, had to listen to the angry mob, lest he be trampled under their angry feet. A missive had been sent from Barre and resultingly, a bunch of guards from the surrounding towns and cities got sent to our town. It must have cost the Baron a lot.

Dad investigated the secret area and found a field of white roses growing in the dark. I didn’t know what to feel that Finn's father had been The executioner, I didn’t want to feel anything about that matter. 

The newly appointed captain of the guards took the new recruits and did a town-wide search and found the secret area. My dad had erased all traces of us and made it seem like he left town. The guards came to that conclusion and relayed the facts to the townspeople. Seeing the massive number of guards patrolling their streets, they had to reluctantly accept the theory. 

Nothing happened the following weeks and the townspeople began celebrating each week that passed without a murder, it was like a small festival that attracted the neighboring towns and cities. The Baron was beyond happy that more people spent money in his town.

Finn had disappeared somewhere, but I couldn’t care less. Karrie and Eric had a hypothesis that he also got taken by the Executioner, which I couldn’t help but find a bit ironic.

And so two months had passed. The leaves were turning brown and thin summer dresses changed into longer dresses and coats. The skin on my left hand had healed on its own but the damaged fingers could still not fully bend. Scars and disfigured flesh marred my skin where the hammer had hit it. 

My mom was beside herself when she first saw me being carried in by my dad. The physical pain was extreme, but the pain of hearing my moms sobbing through the night hurt me more. She had cried two weeks straight. 

My mom had calmed down considerably, now only hovering around me occasionally. A sad expression crept onto her face each time she saw my hands, which made me want to start wearing gloves. When she heard me tell this, she only got sadder. She made me a comfy pair the very next day.

Sitting with my hands clasped in my lap, I glared at the statue towering over me. What’s so funny, huh? The marble face was smiling at me. 

We were visiting the church today. Dad had asked, or demanded, that the head priest use his healing magic on me. He had a more sizable amount of divine mana and could therefore use a higher grade healing spell. The eternally smiling priest frowned for a second as I felt his magic bounce off my body. It felt unpleasant. 

The sun streamed through the stained glass, blinding me in the eyes. Why was I reincarnated? Was this even a reincarnation? I took over someone’s body and still had my old memories. The monks at the temple said that life was like a wheel, neither a start nor an end existed. Is that why I have my memories? Nothing made sense. I felt my body boil.

My face twisted. And why did my knife bounce off his neck? I wouldn’t have been captured had he just died right there and then. It was perfect, he had been successfully lured to a quiet place. The golden circles seemed to protect him. The same golden circles whenever someone lied. I clenched my hands. It hurt.

“Is this your doing?” My voice echoed in the empty prayer room. Silence.

“Why did you send me here?” The goddess just looked at me, smugly.

“What am I supposed to do\!” I stood up.

“I don’t understand.” I said.

“I don’t understand\!” 

The sun stood behind the statue, making a halo out of its rays, not caring in the least that it was blind me.

“Don’t you look at me like that, wipe that goddamn smile off your face\!”

Her gaze was heavy, I fell to my knees.

“Say something… anything…”

“I didn’t ask to be reincarnated…” The carpet felt itchy under my fists.

“I can’t even kill anyone in this life\!” I banged on the carpeted floor, thumps echoed from it.

“I can’t do this…” Something warm rolled down my face, staining the blood-red carpet. “Tell me what to do…”

“Esther\!” Mom ran over me kneeling in front of the statue.   
“What’s wrong?” She hugged me.

I pressed my face into her arms. “Mom…” 

“What is it sweetie? It’s okay, just tell me”

“I want to go home…”

“Of course, we will go home right away.” Her fingers ran through my hair. 

“My sweet little Esther”

\*\*\*  
Today was my birthday, or more correctly, it was Esther’s birthday. I don’t remember my real birthday. Sugar was hard to come by so mom had splurged a bit and baked me a cake. I had never been gifted a cake before so it tickled my heart. 

Invited to my first ever birthday party and Esther's fourteenth party were: my parents, Karrie’s parents, Karrie, and Eric. We had gotten much closer these past months. The cold had at first seeped through the frosted windows, and the naked trees were covered in fluffy white snow. But today the sun had begun to melt the dazzling snow.

“Congratulations Esther\! May the goddess watch over you\!” Karrie said enthusiastically. Yeah, no thanks.

“What are you gonna wish for?” Eric asked.

“Of course she will ask for money\!” Dad said.

“What are you saying? A growing girl only has one thing to wish for, gems and diamonds\!” Karrie’s father retorted.

“Oh, you’re right\! How hind-sighted of me\!”

Karrie’s mom let out a sigh. “You two…”  

“What are you going to wish for?” My mom asked. 

My wish? I’ve never had a chance to wish for something before, I simply didn’t have the time. The room was cozy and had a joyous atmosphere. Dad and Karri’s dad were busy arguing on what a girl like me wanted to wish for. Sighs could be heard getting louder as they argued their points. Karrie and Eric were busy not trying to puke their food out, they ate too much cake. And my mom, with her gentle blue eyes, was busy looking at me. The whole room smelled of food and cake. It made me happy. I felt my mouth curl.

“My wish…” The room went quiet.

My mouth curled into a big smile. The air, warmed up by their smiles and body, felt refreshing as it touched my teeth. “My wish is to always have days like-”

“Sorry Esther, excuse me for a bit.” Someone had knocked on the door. “Let me go check who it is.” My dad checked the door.

“Raviel? What are you doing here?” It was the lady with the pants and blue hair. She wore a thick dress today. 

“I have come here today as a messenger”

“A messenger?” My dad grasped the letter handed to him.

“I shall take my leave then.” She grabbed the side of her skirt, threw a leg back, and bent her knees. It was a perfect curtsy. “My lord” 

By the time I blinked, Raviel was already in the air, dad had lifted her by the neck with one hand.

“Who sent you?” His murderous aura filled the room, dispelling the previous joyful atmosphere.  

Raviel didn’t seem flustered at all.

“Your father.” She uttered.

The sound of something crashing reverberated through the room, signaling the end of my first birthday party.

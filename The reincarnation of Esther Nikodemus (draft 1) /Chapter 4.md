# Chapter 4

“Well I see you still make bad jokes…”

“How about a guessing game?” The girl whom I swore should be dead, got an idea that seemed to be perfect for doing a test.

“That sounds fun, how about we guess each other’s drawings.” I picked up a stick nearby and squatted down in the dirt.

“Well I guess that works”, Eric said.

Let’s start with something easy first, something they would guess correctly. A circle for the body and head, a triangle for the beak and wings, and some lines for the feet. Scribbled into the dirt was a bird. I was quite proud of how it turned out.

Eric and Karrie seemed deep in thought as they squatted over the drawing, our head nearly touching. 

“Uhm, Esther?” Eric broke the silence, looks like he will get the first point.

“I have no idea what these shapes are supposed to be”. 

“Yeah, you’re worse than I thought…”

“What are you guys talking about, it’s obviously a bird.” I couldn’t help but feel a bit indignant.

“Look, there's the beak and the wings, and these lines are the feet.” Pointing at my drawing, I explained to them. 

“I still don’t see it”, Eric said after a momentary pause.

“Me neither”, agreed the girl with the same face.

What are they talking about? Are they stupid? And since when did you become Eric’s yes-man, just stay dead\!

“Well, let's see how much better you are then”, I said, practically shoving the stick to Eric. 

“No need to get so worked up, Esther” 

I don’t want to hear that from you of all people.

“Hmm, let's see”. With a practiced hand, Eric began drawing in the dirt. First there was a square and then a-

“A sword”

“Correct\! A point to Karrie.”

“What, he didn’t even finish it yet”

“It’s obvious if you have played this before”. Upon realising what she just uttered, clamped her mouth shut. “Sorry, I didn’t mean that”

“Let me try again”

It wasn’t my turn yet but I had to check this before I missed my chance. Getting permission, Eric gave the stick back to me. Let’s see if Karrie also has memories of her past life.

*Ann, aren’t you supposed to be dead,* I wrote it in a language only us could understand. I studied her face as she looked at what I drew.

“Esther”, she called my name hesitatingly. 

“What is it?”

“I think we should switch games, this won’t be fair at this point…”

Looking at what I drew, Eric roared. “Hahaha, what is that?\!”

It wasn’t supposed to be something you would guess\! Her face didn’t even flinch when she looked at it. I still had to do more tests.

Upon my insistence, Eric and Karrie agreed to play a few more rounds. The sun in the sky had dipped a bit at this point and the air was getting noticeably cooler. It was on my fourth drawing that the bell rang in the distance, signaling the end of our game. The other kids seemed to also wrap up their games.

I grit my teeth. “This game sucks.” I threw the stick to the ground. 

“Maybe we should have done something else?” Karrie was standing there with 4 points to her name. “Are you heading back too?” 

“Aw, shucks. Esther, you should play with us next time too. I can't believe you got zero points.” He pointed at me and laughed with his stupid winner-smile. He managed to get 5 points. I didn’t try to win, I had better things to do. I concluded that she and Ann only looked alike. Otherwise her poker face was impenetrable, hah, yeah right.

I marched out of there, stomping my feet in the process, only to have the both of them follow me. 

Not wanting to talk to him anymore, I started my march towards the town square. The only problem being the winding alleys and streets all looked the same. I hadn’t really paid attention to the directions. My march got halted after a few stomps.

“That’s the wrong way, Esther. The fountain is this way.” He smirked at me. 

Karrie joined us as Eric led the way and so the three of us began our journey through the alleys. Chatting along the way were the two of them, their topics ranged from this to that. Occasionally, I gave an affirmative “Yes” or “I see” pretending to listen as I focused all my strength in my feet instead. They were really sore. 

“Hey did you hear about the dead people popping up?” I perked my ears towards Karrie.

“I did see that there were more guards than usual lately” 

“Finn said that his dad would get a huge amount of money if he were to catch him”

“That sounds serious”, Eric put his hand to his chin, “how much are we talking about?”

“He said 5 gold coins\!” Karrie gestured with her hands.

“Oh my goddess”, feigning shock he said, “and so, you really believe him?”

“Well…”

He shrugged his shoulders. “I can’t remember the last time he said something that was true”

“You have a point…”

The fountain came into view as we rounded a corner. Mother had met up with father and were currently talking to a woman. Judging by her bow strapped to her back, it must have been one of the hunters in father’s group.

“Miss Victoria\!” Karrie shouted. “We brought Esther back”

Turning her head to having her name being called, she smiled upon seeing us. “Goodness, there's a whole group of you now.” I could hear Eric mumbling my mother’s name. 

“Oh my, how cute. Are these all your children?” The woman with the bow asked.

“As if, one is more than enough for us”, father crouched down, meeting me at my eye level. “Did you make new friends already?”. 

“Yeah, this is Eric and Karrie”

The woman looked at me and then my mother. “I see the resemblance. Nice to meet you, I’m Raviel, I work with your dad.”

“Hello, I’m Esther, I live out of town.” My introduction got a chuckle out of her.

“I suppose it is time for the children to head back, same time next week?”

Father confirmed and Raviel left us, blending through the crowd of people.

“I better leave before I get scolded again. See you guys next time, you too, miss Victoria\!” Eric left waving toward my mother.

“Did that boy just..?” Yes he did, father.

“What a charming boy”, my mother waved back. “Did you come alone today, Karrie? Want to head back with us?”

“If you wouldn't mind”, Karrie said shyly.

With Karrie and I at the front, we began our journey home. It was a wonder how much she could talk by herself. At least she looked happy chatting away. If only she could hear my inner thoughts. 

What would happen if I just killed her again? She wasn’t Ann at the moment, but her face was. Honestly, it was pretty fun playing with them. I enjoyed the experience. *It wouldn’t hurt to just observe her*, I thought to myself, staring at her mouth rapidly opening and closing.

We finally arrived at her house. It looked similar to ours, standing there in the distance. Even the tree in the backyard stood in the same position.

“See ya\! I had fun today, let's play again\!”.

My parents said that they would come visit when the time allowed it, saying farewell to Karrie’s mother, who had come to scold her daughter.

“Was she one of those people who had that idea you were talking about?”

He adjusted the grip on the shopping bag. “Raviel? Yeah, I can’t really tell you all the details.” Raviel’s employer had apparently found a treasure map and needed some experienced people that knew the lay of the land. No one knew this place better than his group and that was why she and her employer had approached them.

“I don’t know about this idea of hers, doesn’t it sound dangerous? Such a high sum just for some guide work…”

“You know how nobles think and act. How about this”, he tried to reassure her, “I will tell my men to immediately run should I sense anything dangerous. This job would bring our coffers back to a comfortable state.” He planted a kiss on the back of her hand. 

“I’m sorry for making you always do all this work…”

“Nothing to be sorry about, I chose to marry you, remember?” That’s weird, I thought to myself. They both said the same thing.

Getting tucked in by my mother became a routine after I had moved rooms. It still felt awkward as I laid there, the blanket covering half of my face. 

“Did you have fun today?”

I nodded.

It was a bit of a commotion when my legs gave out and father had to carry me the rest of the way. She had fretted about the house blaming herself for not taking better care of me. It wasn’t until father comforted her saying that none of it was her fault, that a child had to fall to learn how to pick themself up. 

My mother patted my stomach as she sat there with a somber expression. 

“I drew a bird today”

“Really?”

“They said that I had talent”

“Of course, my daughter is the most talented person in the world.” She planted a kiss on my forehead. 

Her mood always changed whenever something happened to me. Happy, when something good happened. Sad, when something bad happened. Apparent even to me, I could see how much she loved her daughter. I must be a better daughter so that she won’t be sad so often.

She left the room, seeing as my eyes drooped. Today was really tiring. I met someone who already knew Esther, someone who didn’t know her and even got to play with other kids for the first time. The skewers were good and the thought of the sweet candy I snatched from Eric, made the corners of my mouth turn up a bit. 

A sudden realization shook off my drowsiness. I had forgotten my main goal. Laying on top of my desk was my pouch still filled with the ten copper coins. The whole point of me going out to town today was to spend it. I had forgotten my main goal. This had never happened before. I couldn’t decide whether this was a good or a bad sign.

Tomorrow, I would spend some money tomorrow, whatever it took.

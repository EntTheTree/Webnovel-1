# Chapter 16

Karrie always said that my mom was several times better than her own. I had agreed each time because it was simply true. Victoria was prettier with her unblemished fair skin and silky smooth hair, she wasn't too thin nor too thick and she had a gentle voice and face. This isn’t meant to make Karrie’s mom appear to be some hideous person, she was just, average. 

However, standing here with my hands behind my back, I felt scared. Gone was the gentle mother who always gave me a hug, gone was the gentle smile she always had, and gone was my fantasy of unconditional love. Victoria was standing there with a face that I never wanted her to wear. I couldn’t look at her any longer and watched my feet instead. 

“Esther\!” She was yelling. 

“How could you just shove her like that\!” My ears rang.

“Victoria, it was just children arguing. Besides, no one got hurt.”

“Getting hurt or not, she shouldn’t have resolved to use violence\! What if we get kicked out?”

“Wouldn’t that be for the best?”

“Take this seriously Galen\! She hurt a noble\!”

“I don’t get what’s so special about nobles.” I said.

“Esther\!” Her shout stunned me. The floorboards stayed silent.

“Why Esther\! What if she broke something\!”

“What am I going to do? I have to apologize to Lady Estelle. I have to apologize to Lady Grace. I have to apologize…”

“There is so much happening\! Why is this happening\!?” 

“Victoria\! Stop that\!” My mother was pulling at her hair. 

“Esther, go wait outside for a bit, okay?”

I collapsed in front of the door, my knees couldn't bear my own weight anymore. My fingers couldn’t stop trembling and my heart hurt. If only I could remove this useless organ. Remove everything. I always thought my mother to be a strong person. Hell or heaven she always wore a smile. It always made me feel at ease. But the muffled yelling I heard behind the door made me regret ever having that thought. Then I heard blood-curdling wailing. Then I heard sobbing. And then it went quiet. My mother wasn't strong, she was just pretending.

The movement of the door made me flinch. My fathers face peeked out. 

“Esther, you’re still here?”

“Dad, I’m sorry…” 

“Oh, dear, come here.” My vision soared to his eye level.

“Let’s let your mother rest for a bit, okay? She is just a little tired is all.” I could only nod as I watched the golden circle blind me.

My father had carried me somewhere with a tea table. I watched as I saw him put three sugar cubes in my cup. It was hot. He hadn’t said anything while he carried me nor did he say anything as we sat. He was just staring at me. What would he say if I told him his daughter was dead?

“Can you tell me why you did it?”

“She said bad things about mom…”

“What things?”

“She called her an orphan servant…”

“Hah…” 

“I would normally tell you you did well, I really can’t this time.”

“Do you know why your mother is always so sad?” I shook my head.

“It’s because of me.” What was he saying?

“Because of your useless father, your mother had to experience things that slowly chipped away at her heart. Eventually, we had you and her heart began to fix itself.” He smiled.

“That’s why you are our treasure, do you understand, Esther?”

“Not really…”

“It’s fine if you don’t understand right now. Just make sure you are happy and healthy okay?” I nodded. 

“Want to go visit your mother?”

“Yeah…” 

My mother had fallen asleep. Her eyes were red and puffy and her hair was messy. Her fists were clenching the blanket as if it was the most important thing in the world. Looking into the mirror, I saw a similar face looking back. Puffy red eyes. I seemed to have cried along the way. My heart felt heavy as I looked at my mother, she was pitiful. There had to be a way to help her. I crept into her bed and under her blanket. It was warm as I nestled myself against her. I’m sorry mom.

TK tea party with grandmother and estelle.

“Have you two made up?” I glanced at Estelle.

Today was another day where I was to have tea with the Duchess and Estelle was joining us. 

“I have already said my apologies. I’m waiting for mine.” Apologizing to her was no easy feat. Whenever I tried to say ‘I’m sorry’ or ‘I didn’t mean to’ the golden circle blocked my mouth. In the end my apology had only vague words and phrases.

“You call that an apology? You just said some nonsense\!”

“Better that than nothing at all.”

“Oh my girls, that’s not how you reconcile with each other." My grandmother smiled at us. 

“Why would I reconcile with her? She’s a violent person\!”

“Would you rather get angry every time you meet her?”

“Yes\!”

“That would be exhausting, Estelle. Do you know why you are angry?”

“Of course I do\! It’s because–” She thought for a second. “Because her mom is a bad person\!” She was still on with this? I had to control myself.

“And what about Eshter over here, why are you angry at her?”

“She pushed me\!”

“But you said some hurtful things did you not? What would you do if Esther was the one who said the same things you said.” 

“I would…” 

“It seems you have now understand, putting yourself in others' shoes is the first thing you have to do to learn to communicate with others. New perspectives will broaden your sights, you have read a lot of books have you not?”

“However, Esther. You should have tried to solve the conflict with your words instead of your hands. As such I want you to give an apology first, can you do that?” 

Solving things with words? I almost burst out into laughter hearing that coming from her. Words had never worked when it mattered the most. People will choose to ignore words or nitpick the parts that they themselves like. A word could have several meanings for different people, but getting hit in the face? That will make them immediately understand the meaning. And she wants me to give an apology first? 

“Why should I apologize first again. She was the one who insulted my mother.”

“Are you angry at her, Esther?”

“Yes, wouldn’t that be obvious?”

“Then all the more reason to apologise first.” I couldn’t help but think of the Duchess as being absurd. 

TK little more dialogue.

“Try it.” How am I supposed to say something I didn’t even mean? This thing wouldn’t make me be able to lie either. 

“Would you rather your mom apologize for you?” I saw her gray eyes stare at me. I had forgotten. The real reason why I willingly attended today’s tea party even when Estelle was here. My mom had told me that morning that she was sorry for yelling at me, and that she would take care of it. She had smiled as usual but the illusion had already broken. I saw myself reflected in her eyes. This was something I had to solve myself. She already sacrificed so much of herself.

I turned to Estelle. She had an irritating face. Her lips looked pale, her eyes were too sharp, and she would definitely develop wrinkles with the way she was furrowing her eyebrows. 

“Lady Estelle, I was angry at you when you said those things, but I shouldn’t have retaliated in that manner. I want to apologise.” It had been a while since I bowed my head to apologize. 

“Well… I did say some harsh things. You can just call me Estelle…”

The rest of the tea party continued while the Duchess had a wide grin on her face.

“Grandmother, is it true that you are dying?”

“Where did you hear that?”

“Everywhere…”

“Then it must be true.” She sipped her cup of tea.

TK scene with aunt where she is drunk and says how similar she is to victoria, hint background lore.

My aunt had called for me when she spotted me going back to my room. She was resting in the lounge drinking wine. 

“You, what’s your name”

“It is Esther, my lady”

“Funny.”

“Come closer” I felt her floral fragrance as I stepped closer. It was mixed in with the smell of alcohol. 

“You really do look like her…” 

“You can go now.” I curtsied and left the room.

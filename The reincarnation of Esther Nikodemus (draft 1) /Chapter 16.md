# Chapter 16

Planning a murder wasn’t hard. One, decide on a murder weapon. Two, find a secluded space. Three, try not to let the Goddess interfere. This put a wrench in my usual planning, I couldn’t personally kill them. The Baroness was sleeping in her bed, not even noticing that someone had snuck in.

It wasn’t particularly hard to do, the door wasn’t locked after all. Such a careless woman was the one tutoring me? I thought it to be absurd as I rummaged through her drawers. There was nothing interesting to find. This woman was getting paid one gold every week, where was she using it?

Next the closet. Three identical green dresses greeted me as they hung limp in the moonshine. Actually, not identical. One of them had a different embroidery on the sleeve, another had a different neckline and that one had pockets sewn onto it. Looking at the other eight dresses all neatly lined up in different shades of green, lime and even verdant, didn’t make it hard to learn that her favorite color was green.

The old woman stirred as I closed the closet. She rolled over to her side with an unpleasant expression, and snoring sounds began to rise from her mouth. Should I try suffocating her? My legs stood right beside her bed. Wrap my hands around her neck and cut off the air making her snore. My hands shrunk back to the sides of my body, they only managed to wrap halfway across her neck.

About to leave her bedroom, something shining in her bed caught my attention. She was clutching a box.

There was no lesson today, meaning no Baroness Bayonne to torment me.

“Young lady, is something the matter?”

A pair of maids stood in the hall busily dusting away the displayed decorations. One of them was a vase with yellow flowers.

“Do you want some candy?”

“Stop giving her whatever is in your pocket…”

This maid occasionally gave me candy and had been witness to the incident with the plates. Her hair was braided in a ponytail that fluttered in the air whenever she turned. Looks like it was strawberry flavored this time.

I gave her one of my more practiced curtsies. “Thank you.”

“Ah, how cute\!” The candy maid squealed.

“You’ve improved a lot haven’t you?”

“Of course she has\! Why else would that sour woman still be getting paid\!”

“Hmm, you’re right about that”

The other maid poking her own cheek had a mole above where her finger was. It suited her.

“My lady, can you do this with your hands?” Her hands were sticking out from the top of her head.

“Now tilt your head a little and say—”

“Meow?”

Candy maid fell to her knees as if she had been shot. She was clutching her chest. “Ah, my heart\!”

“Pfft\! Ahaha\! Stop teaching her to do silly things\! Bwahaha\!”

I didn’t know what was so funny to them, still this had become a routine of sorts every time I met them. Hearing their laughter echo across the hall did make me feel a bit more upbeat.

“Do you want to play with us today? We still have some work left to do…”

“It’s okay, I don’t want to play today.” They both gaped.

“Huh? Why not? Did that woman do something again?” The candy maid shook her fist. “I ought to really give her a talking to.”

“Ha… And what are you going to say to her? Alden personally hired her, you know?”

“Oh, my little lady, how my heart aches for you\!”

“You’re being a bit dramatic.”

“Pfft\!”

“I’m on a mission today.”

“A mission you say? That sounds very serious”, said the other maid.

I nodded.

“Well, good luck on your mission, and let us know if some scoundrel shows up okay?”

“We’ll beat them black and blue for you\!” I returned their wave with my own.

“My, if it isn’t little miss Esther\! Sorry but I already promised Lady Victoria that I wouldn’t give you any more snacks.” He closed one of his eyes. “Here take this.” The chef handed me a cookie, it tasted buttery.

The kitchen was always busy with several people flying around. There were many employees that worked and lived in the estate, and ensuring enough food for them was tiring work. A delicious smell wafting in the air made my mouth water a little.

“What are you making today?”

“Hmm, we got our hands on some prime cuts of deer today. Pair that up with some wine reduced demi-glace and garlic infused mushrooms and there you have it. How does that sound?”

“Sounds amazing.”

“Haha\! Amazing indeed\! You always have the best compliments.”

“Then, can you make my plate have fewer mushrooms this time too?”

“Miss Esther, you shouldn’t be too picky with your food, you know? Even my daughter is taller than you.” He indicated with his hand her height. It was half a head above my own.

“I can’t get taller by eating mushrooms.”

“On the contrary, I heard someone say mushrooms make you taller.” He smiled with a big golden circle on his mouth."

“Please?”

“That won’t work on me, miss.” He crossed his burly arms.

Fine, let me try that move. Hands above my head alluding to ears of some kind, tilt my head twenty degrees to the left, and finally.

“Please?”

He stared sideways at me.

“Ha… But this is the last time okay?”

“Thank you my good sir.” I gave him my curtsy, making him give a hum of approval.

“Speaking of, have you seen my locket?” I glanced at his neck, there was nothing there today.

“Did you lose it?”

“It appears so… Keep an eye out for it okay? I will do whatever I can if you can find it.”

I nodded.

Standing in the forest-like garden, I stared at the gardener snipping off flowers. The large scissors made quick work as he cut them across their body, letting their heads fall pathetically to the dirty ground.

“Well if it isn’t Eshter, what brings you here to this old man today?” He went down the ladder upon spotting me.

“Do you know of any good hiding spots? I need to find a secluded space.”

“Hello, Sir Gardener. Do you know of any secluded spots in the garden?”

“Secluded you say? Are you playing hide and seek outside this time? That’s good, someone young like you should take in the fresh air instead of staying cooped up all the time. I remember when— oh, my apologies. Let's see… there is the area behind the annex, the shed, oh. Maybe the abandoned church would be a good hiding place?”

“Abandoned church?”

“Shocking isn't it? The previous Duke was such a devoted man that he constructed a small church behind the annex where we live, or so they say. Don’t tell anyone this, but the former Duke told me that the weekly trip to the main church in the duchy had taken too much of his time. I need to visit the church every Sunday? Then just let me construct one in my back yard\! Hah\! What a remarkable man.”

My mind went blank while listening to him regale his story.

“It’s over there if you want to check it out, be careful not to trip on the roots okay?”

I hopped around the forest that stood behind the annex. The building was a little smaller than the main building but it was longer. Finally reaching the first trees had already made me sweat. And there it was, a gray building where nature itself had taken over. Vines spread around and wrapped itself on its walls, and green moss had found their home, acting just like a carpet. A green carpet that welcomed me into this broken down church.

The Goddess stood in her always indifferent pose looking down at me. A hole in the ceiling made the sunlight stream in, lighting up the broken brick particles, as it caressed the statue, lighting her face up. Stop acting all important. The hole was just a coincidence.

Sitting on one of the few usable benches, all I could hear was the soft rustling of leaves and vines. The statue stood at the top of the altar, where vines had wrapped itself all over it and small cracks could be seen here and there. Even in that state of decay, her face had been free of invading plants or cracks. She just stood there, happy, smiling like an idiot. Your stupid little tricks won’t stop me this time.

The gentle wind and the calm atmosphere tried to lull me to sleep. My body felt heavy as I had exerted a lot of energy coming here.

“There you are, my sweet daughter.” My mom sat down beside me.

“Does the statue of the Goddess still make you feel uneasy?”

“How did you know?”

“You’re my daughter are you not? Your mother knows everything.” She stared at the statue.

“But you know Esther, If there is someone to blame, then it would be me.”

“What do you mean, mom?”

“If only I had been more watchful that day, then those things wouldn’t happen to you…”

“It’s not your fault, mom.”

“If not mine, then whose? Who can I blame if not myself?” My mom didn’t smile anymore as she bowed her head.

“I’m sorry Esther… those things shouldn’t have happened to you…” She cupped her face.

“Mom.”

“And now we have to stay here for who knows how long…”

I shook my slumped over mother. “Mom, I’m fine.” Her face scrunched up, making lines between her nose and eyebrows.

“It’s fun here at the estate. The food is good and the bed feels like a cloud.” I listed all the interesting and fun things I had experienced at the estate. The maids that would sometimes give me candy, the chef that would let me taste new recipes and the gardener that meticulously pruned all the bushes and flowers. Paintings that showed different aspects of life and other things. I told her everything. My breath had run out at the end.

“I see…” Good, she didn’t start crying.

Her warm arms wrapped around me as her cheek nuzzled against the top of my head.

“My daughter was having so much fun all this time… I didn’t even notice.” Her voice rumbled through my hair.

We stayed at the abandoned church for a little while longer before a servant called us to dinner. Sorry mom, but there was one thing I didn’t mention. One thing that wasn’t fun.

# Chapter 14: tutor

Franziska found herself in the ducal house of Nikodemus and couldn’t hide the joy in her step as one of the servants showed her to the parlor. She had been hired to teach a child in the ducal house how to behave as a noble. An adopted child perhaps, but it didn’t matter. The goddess herself had looked down upon her and helped this situation to be. One more month and she would find herself broke and poor\! 

Saving money was something only the poor did, she thought. Therefore, as soon as some coin had gathered in her hands, she would use it immediately. What is money if not to show off? 

There was once a time when Franzsiska didn’t get to buy a particular item in time for the tea party hosted by her friend Countess Belford, and the humiliation she felt. That day had been ingrained in her soul ever since.

How was such a woman able to fund her lifestyle you ask? Simple really. She was one of the most sought after and acknowledged tutorers in the whole duchy. Several noble families had hired her and the results spoke for themself. If only that scandal didn’t happen.

A maid beckoned her to come as the child had finally come. Raising herself from the luxurious and soft sofa, she was looking forward to teaching again. The maid grabbed the door handle and opened it. It was blinding. 

The sun shone through the tall windows straight unto a girl with golden hair standing in the middle of the room. Her arms laid limply by her dress and she was staring. Staring at what? Franzsiska wanted to turn around and find out the thing that was taking her attention but the sudden movements of the girl made that thought disappear. 

“Good morning, my name is Esther and I am fourteen.”

A peculiar greeting came from the girl. As expectant from her appearance, her voice carried something angelic about it, it was high but not grating on the ears. In fact, Franzsiska thought her voice to be lovely. If only her curtsy wasn't that… terrible. She had to suppress the sigh trying to come out of her as she observed her movements. Adopted or not, a noble child should at least be able to do a simple curtsy. 

“Its terrible”

“Sorry?”

“Your curtsy, its terrible”

“Oh, I didn’t think it was that bad…”  

“That’s what I should be asking. Who taught you?”

“I see that the Duke has a good eye for judgement.”

“No one, I copied my mother.”

Ah, I see. She must be a child of a mistress. Don’t worry, your grace. I will keep this secret to my grave\!

“My name is Franzsiska Bayonne. You may call me either Lady Bayonne or Baroness Bayonne, understood?”

The girl took a second to answer and nodded. Haa… Think about the money\!

The first lesson Franzsiska Bayonne taught the girl was a lesson in greetings. 

“First, no nodding. When spoken to you must either answer or pretend not to have heard.”

“Second, a curtsy is one of the first and most important things a woman has in her arsenal. Think of it as a sharpened knife you brought to a battlefield.”

“Now show me a proper curtsy this time.”

“Yes, Baroness Bayonne.”

The girl did as told and was contrary to expectations, quick on the uptake. After a dozen times, her curtsy got a passing grade. However, it was barely. The way she lifted the skirt with her left hand was not elegant at all. Stiff as a brick that hand it was. 

“Thats it for this morning. Any questions?”

“If I may, Baroness Bayonne. Do you know what a shopping center is?”

“A shopping center? I suppose I do not.”

The girl said her farewell and that morning’s lesson was finished. Franziska felt terribly tired. Had she gotten old? Nonsense, that child was at fault. Her manner of speaking was one thing, but her face. What an unexpressive child she was. Aloof, just like the nobles Franziska had met several times. How could such a young girl already develop such a weapon? From the way she stood and moved, she must have come from commoner roots. TK maybe add in commonor racism.

“Hey, why do you think that pair is getting such good treatment? I understand that the woman is pretty and that the man is handsome with that chiseled face… But aren’t they just some commoners?”

“Are you silly? That’s the duke’s youngest son you are talking about\!”

“Gasp\! What? The Duke’s youngest?

“Shh\! From what I’ve heard he got banished or something from the Duchy a couple years back.”

“What did he do?”

“Not him, that woman he has with him. What do you think? She seduced him.”

Franzsiska heard the couple of maids gossip while cleaning the guest room. What information she had gotten her hands on. She flung the door open, making the maids freeze in shock.

“You two there. Tell me more about this seductress.”

The sun had fallen and it was time for the second lesson of the day. The Duke had given Franzsiska a list of things that the girl needed to learn, giving her full permission to use whatever was available. Honestly, he didn’t have to give her something so useless, everything was in need of learning. 

So this girl is that child of the seductress? She thought. She certainly inherited the looks. Another few years and this commoner would certainly latch unto some unfortunate rich noble and bleed him dry. 

“The next thing you need to learn is how to walk. Place this plate on your head.”

At least she was obedient. A maid she had asked to help out handed her a plate.

“Now walk toward that wall over there. No using your hands either.”

“Wont the plate fall then?”

“Not if you do it correctly. Now walk.”

“Baroness Bayonne, I don’t think its–”

“Haa.. I see that there is some delusion you have gotten yourself into. The Duke has hired me to make you, a commoner, into something that at least passes itself off as something noble on the surface. I suppose this must be too much for a young child like yourself.”

“I will do it…”

The plate trembled precariously as her feet shuffled across the floor. This exercise was a common way to teach children on how to walk with an even gait while maintaining a straight back. It was normally done with a book on their head, but Franzsiska thought that to be frightfully boring. Besides, there were no books to be seen in the whole estate.

Unexpectedly, the plate didn’t fall as she reached the wall. This wouldn’t do. 

“Now turn around and walk back.”

After a slight pause, the girl turned to her right. The polished porcelain plate floated in the air as the floor pulled it downwards. How many plates would she break today? She watched excitedly as the plate reached the girl's waist, then a hand shot out. It appeared under the plate gripping it to stop descending. What useless reflexes, she thought. A crashing sound rang out in the parlor room. The girl was clutching her left hand over the broken pieces of porcelain. 

“Tsk, not even a full turn and you dropped it already. As expected of–”

Franzsiska froze. The scared expression she imagined didn’t present itself. She was glaring at her. A cold ran down her spine as she stared into her eyes. You dare look at me like that\! A mere commoner\!

“Should I clean this up, my lady?”

“Leave it. Give her another plate.”

“But what about the broken–”

“Who are you?”

“I’m sorry, my lady…”

“Esther was it? What’s with that impudent stare?”

Killing wasn’t something I particularly enjoyed, it just happened. It was as if something gripped my heart, squeezing it, pressing into it, making the organ feel like exploding. My heart had been fine ever since that incident, it was honestly refreshing. The failure must have shocked it out of my body, I thought. I could live this life without killing anyone as the goddess intended. 

I could wake up to my mom greeting me with her gentle smile and father telling a joke or stories. But the feeling I thought had been gone, reared its head again today. 

I remember the first time I felt it. Every time on the way back from school, there was something that always caught my attention. It was some old woman sleeping on the ground. Everyday, everytime, just like how the hands on a clock always turned, she was always lying there on that piece of tattered cardboard. The same dirty clothes, the same dirty paper cup and the same disgusting hunched silhouette. 

There was one day when she didn’t sleep there. I felt relieved, it was a miracle. No more would my tiring walk be interrupted by some selfish person thinking the street was their own. I threw away her cardboard. 

The next day, she appeared again. The same dirty clothes, the same dirty paper cup and the same disgusting silhouette greeted me on the way home. She was sleeping on the ground. That was the moment when I felt my heart rip to pieces.

It was remarkable how much better it felt with her gone. Sure, her shocked expression as I jammed a knife in her throat, slashing the carotid making the blood spurt out of her like a fountain, surfaced whenever I slept or ate, studied or went to use the toilet, but that was a small price to pay to protect the only enjoyable time of my day. 

A week after I killed her, Ann pulled me to the side to ask me something.

# Chapter 14.5

The tea party ended a short while after that. I had a few more tea parties with my grandmother and the day finally came for when the rest of the Nikodemus family arrived. 

We stood behind my father who was at the side of the Duke with a professional smile on his face.

“Father\! It is good to be back\!” The oldest was the first to arrive. Giving the Duke a big hug. He had a well-trimmed mustache.

“It is good to meet Your Grace again.” His wife gave her greeting. The jewelry she wore sparkled like stars in the night sky, it was hard to count them all.

“Grandpa\! Julian is here.” The youngest shouted excitedly.

“Julian, that’s not how you greet His Grace.” The oldest rebuked his brother.

“Let me go, you rascal. I just met you last week.”

“Haha\! No need to be shy, father.”

“Oh is that really you Galen?” He stood in front of my father.

“I really thought I would never see you again. Give me a hug\!”

He stopped the approaching man. “A handshake is enough.”

The wife stepped up to greet my mother. “Long time no see, Victoria. Ah, I meant sister-in-law.”

“Good to see you too, Lady Paulina.” My mother gave a slight curtsy. “You look dazzling today.” The jewellery glistened as she nodded her head in agreement.

“Brother, who are they?”

“Our uncle and aunt, think.”

“Does that mean that pretty girl is our cousin?” The brothers turned their heads to me. 

“You shouldn’t act friendly with them.” He tried to whisper. They all had black hair and eyes, only my uncle’s wife had a different hue. She had fiery red hair.

“The road must have made you weary. Alden, why don’t you show them to their rooms.”

He gave a bow and went with the servants and maids to show them in. I curtsied as they went past us, not turning their head away from the entrance, however I saw the youngest turning backwards right before entering.

The family of four consisted of my mustached uncle Gilbert, his dazzling wife Paulina, and their two sons, Levi and Julian. They both looked older than me. 

My mother let out a tired sigh, another carriage had arrived. Her hand left a crinkle in her newly ironed dress.

The carriage rolled noisily across the 

The carriage bore the Nikodemus family crest, a black rose. Black was a color often seen in the Nikodemus Estate. My grandparents had black hair and so did their children. I had wandered into the portrait room, where I saw paintings of all the direct living members of the Nikodemus family. Father wasn’t included to be found in the room making it easy to see a pattern. All the grandchildren of Duke Nikodemus had black hair. 

The carriage stopped and an elegant woman stepped out. No one escorted her. Everything about her screamed sharp. Her jawline was sharp, her mouth was sharp and her eyes were sharp as a fox. Her black hair hung freely from her head with no embellishments, her only accessories being a pair of red earrings and the ring on her left hand. This had to be my aunt, Lady Grace. Her two daughters cemented that fact as they were escorted by the stationed knights. 

Lady Grace went up the stairs, her shoes rang out each time she took a step, and gave her father a perfect curtsy. 

“Good to see you, father. Have you been well?” 

“Where’s your husband?” he asked.

“He is busy with his business.” 

“Will he be coming soon?” 

She looked up. “Who knows?” Her smile did not reach her eyes.

Before the Duke could say something, her two daughters had already lined up ready to give their greetings. 

“Greetings, Your Grace”. The older one gave a neat and concise greeting, she looked to be my age.

“Hello grandpa\!” The younger one gave out a lively childlike greeting, befitting her age. The Duke gave a simple nod and told Raviel to show them in.

My sharp-featured aunt went past my father, not even saying a word to him, and stopped right in front of my mother. She looked down at my moms bowed head.

“I see you have come crawling back.” She spat.

“Greetings, Lady Grace.” My mom said, her head still bowed.

“And this must be your daughter.” Her fox-like eyes glared at me. The gaze felt like sharp knives as they pierced into me before looking me up and down. She was most interested in my golden hair. She clicked her tongue and began walking away, the sound of heels followed her as she marched. 

Following their mother, the youngest looked at me and began walking towards me, leaving her mother’s side. She had the same black hair as her mother and her eyes appeared to be more akin to a cat’s than a fox. Her hair was styled into twintails, a red ribbon adorning each tail.

“Who are you?” She looked at me with eyes full of curiosity. 

“Hello, My name is Eshter. I am fourteen.”

“Wow\! You’re the same age as my big sister, your names sound the same too\! Estelle and Esther." The young girl bounced excitedly up and down, finding that fact funny. 

“Leah, you shouldn’t talk to her like that.” Her sister looked at me with uninterested eyes. 

“Why not?” Her little sister asked. 

“That’s because you don’t need to introduce yourself to the servants.” 

She smirked at me.

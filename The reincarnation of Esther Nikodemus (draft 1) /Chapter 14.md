# Chapter 14

“It’s been a while since I’ve had a tea party, how joyous.”

“Likewise, Your Grace.”

“How long are you going to keep calling me that?” She blew gently on the cup and took a sip.

“Yes, Lady Rosalynn.”

“Hmm, that works too.”

It was a surreal scene. Grandfather and father had gone to fix some paperwork making us three the ones left. My mom and my grandmother, who I had once killed, were happily chatting and reminiscing about the past. Her familiar voice had me rooted to my seat, it rang out with clear intonation and had a warmth to it. It was hard to listen to. The plate of sweets and cookies served to me stood there, untouched. Shaded from the midday sun, the two of them talked about this and that sitting under the gazebo, the mention of my name tickled my ears.

“Have you planned her debut yet?”

A social debut was a party of some sort, the intention being to introduce children to society. The biggest debut party was held in the capital, but smaller and less glamorous debuts could be found strewn across the bigger cities across the empire. It was common for nobles to debut the year they turned fifteen. 

“We are not planning to stay here for long, a month at most…”

“Is that right?”

“And besides, we don’t have the finances to attend, we are currently living as commoners as you may have heard.”

“It’s a shame really.” She put her hand to her cheek. “Your daughter looks so similar to you when you were younger. She would have easily been the flower of the debut ball.” 

“Has Galen told you about my proposition?”

“He has.” My mom lowered her eyes.

“Would you two be willing to accept?”

“Lady Rosalyn.” She stared straight ahead. “We are currently living a happy and comfortable life. I have my trusty husband and my lovely daughter by my side, they mean everything to me.”

“I see. I offered it in the hopes of it being an adequate apology, however my old age must by showing. I should have just done this.” She put down her cup gently.

“As the Duchess of house Nikodemus, I Rosalyn Nikodemus, want to formally apologize to you.” She bowed deeply enough to touch the table.

“I am sorry.”

My mom flew upwards flustered. “Your Grace\! You shouldn’t bow your head to someone like me\!”

“Oh hush, I can apologize to my daughter can’t I?”

“Rosalyn…”

“Would you accept this selfish dying woman's apology?”

“Of course\! Please lift your head\!”

“You are still too soft, Victoria.” Rosalyn furrowed her eyebrows. “But thank you dear, my heart feels lighter now.” A gold circle formed in front of her mouth.

“I’m glad.” A smile crept onto her face. “I’ve never once held you responsible for what happened, you never did anything to me.”

My grandmother looked determined. “Exactly. I did nothing.” 

“My offer still stands, please consider it.”

“I shall try”

With the situation resolved, we sat in silence letting the cool wind feel our faces.

“Would you grant another wish of mine?”

“Of course, what is it?”

“Could you lend me your daughter when we arrive? I didn’t have the chance to get to know my granddaughter last time.”

The atmosphere in the Estate has gotten lighter and livelier ever since the Lady of the house was back in her rightful place. Servants and maids alike could be heard whispering about how healthy and happy she looked. It didn’t feel like we were preparing for her passing at all. The priests must have been wrong about the diagnosis, I heard them surmise. Walking down the hallway on the fourth floor, the gossiping maids smiled at me warmly as I passed them by. I was on my way to have a private tea party with the Duchess. 

Knocking on the huge door, a voice inviting me in could be heard. The Duchess’ room was twice the size of mine on the third floor. All the small bits and bobs of decoration had been removed, making it look minimalistic, frugal even. The Duchess was sitting at a table conversing with a maid.

I bent my leg behind me and grabbed the hem of my skirt, giving a curtsy. “Good afternoon, Your Grace.”

“My, have you already learnt noble etiquette? How was her curtsy, Alice?” 

“It looked graceful and practiced.” The maid with long straight brown hair said. The Duchess beamed.

“Here take a seat, I heard you liked sweets.”

“Thank you, I shall do so.”

“Even her manner of talking is elegant.” She covered her mouth, turning excitedly to her maid.

On the table stood a myriad different desserts, a pink colored cake, dried and fresh fruits, and some sweet smelling cookies. They looked to be freshly baked. Still, the thing that grabbed my attention, making the desserts a mere distraction, was her face. She had the same smile as Victoria, it fit her surprisingly.

“May I ask you a question, Your Grace.”

“Please call me grandmother, and talk like how you normally do. It’s just us here.”

I glanced at Alice, she nodded.

“Okay, can I ask you a question, grandmother?”

“Of course\! Go ahead.”

“Were you and mom close? You two act the same.”

“Really? We do?”

“You have the same smile.”

“Your mom must be really happy then.” Her eyes formed into crescent moons.

“I don’t know.”

“Oh? Why is that?”

“My mom has cried a lot lately. She always looked sad before meeting you yesterday.” 

“It must have been too early… thank you for telling me, Esther.”

“Thank you too, grandmother.”

She told me some stories of her youth and how her husband, the Duke, had asked her to marry him. It was one of her happiest days when the moody man proposed to her. 

"A lot happened after that but I can still vividly remember when I saw you for the first time. Do you remember dear?”

“I’m sorry, I still don’t remember anything from the past.”

“It may be better that way, you shouldn't have needed to experience that.” I simply nodded.

The tea party ended a short while after that. I had a few more tea parties with my grandmother and the day finally came for when the rest of the Nikodemus family arrived. We stood behind my father who was at the side of the Duke with a professional smile on his face.

“Father\! It is good to be back\!” The oldest was the first to arrive. Giving the Duke a big hug. He had a well-trimmed mustache.

“It is good to meet Your Grace again.” His wife gave her greeting. The jewelry she wore sparkled like stars in the night sky, it was hard to count them all.

“Grandpa\! Julian is here.” The youngest shouted excitedly.

“Julian, that’s not how you greet His Grace.” The oldest rebuked his brother.

“Let me go, you rascal. I just met you last week.”

“Haha\! No need to be shy, father.”

“Oh is that really you Galen?” He stood in front of my father.

“I really thought I would never see you again. Give me a hug\!”

He stopped the approaching man. “A handshake is enough.”

The wife stepped up to greet my mother. “Long time no see, Victoria. Ah, I meant sister-in-law.”

“Good to see you too, Lady Paulina.” My mother gave a slight curtsy. “You look dazzling today.” The jewellery glistened as she nodded her head in agreement.

“Brother, who are they?”

“Our uncle and aunt, think.”

“Does that mean that pretty girl is our cousin?” The brothers turned their heads to me. 

“You shouldn’t act friendly with them.” He tried to whisper. They all had black hair and eyes, only my uncle’s wife had a different hue. She had fiery red hair.

“The road must have made you weary. Alden, why don’t you show them to their rooms.”

He gave a bow and went with the servants and maids to show them in. I curtsied as they went past us, not turning their head away from the entrance, however I saw the youngest turning backwards right before entering.

The family of four consisted of my mustached uncle Gilbert, his dazzling wife Paulina, and their two sons, Levi and Julian. They both looked older than me. My mother let out a tired sigh, another carriage had arrived. Her hand left a crinkle in her newly ironed dress.

A woman went up and curtsied. “Good to see you, father.” The best descriptor I found was that she looked sharp.

“Where’s your husband?” he asked.

“He is busy with his business.” 

“Will he be coming soon?” She looked up.

“Who knows?”

I saw that the Duke wanted to say something, but two girls went up and gave their greetings before he had the chance.

“Greetings, Your Grace”. The older one gave a neat and concise greeting, she looked to be my age.

“Hello grandpa\!” The younger one gave out a lively childlike greeting, befitting her age.

“Raviel, why don’t you show them in?” To the left of him stood Raviel. She did the same as Alden and began showing them the way.

My sharp-featured aunt went past my father, not even saying a word and stopped right in front of my mother. She looked down at my moms bowed head.

“I see you came crawling back.” She spat.

“Greetings, Lady Grace.” My mom still had her head bowed.

“And this must be your daughter.” Her sharp eyes glared at me, her gaze felt like knives piercing me as she slashed me up and down. Having had her fill, she clicked her tongue and began walking away. Her heels clacked loudly in my ears as she marched with her two daughters in tow, who also looked at me. 

The youngest came up to me. She had the same black hair and eyes as all the direct descendants of house Nikodemus, the only ones looking different were my other aunt, my mother, and I. Maybe my other uncle also had a different hair color, however, it was still easy to see that black hair symbolized house Nikodemus.

“Who are you?” She asked me with eyes full of curiosity. Probably why a girl with blonde hair and blue eyes was present.

“Hello, My name is Eshter. I am fourteen.”

“Wow\! You’re the same age as my big sister, Estelle. Your names sound the same too\!\!” The young girl bounced excitedly up and down. 

“Leah, you shouldn’t talk to her like that.” Her sister looked at me with dispassionate eyes. 

“Why not?” Her little sister asked curiously. 

“You don’t need to introduce yourself to the servants.” 

She smirked at me.

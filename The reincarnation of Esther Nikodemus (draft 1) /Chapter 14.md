# Chapter 14: duchess

The tower of cookies and cakes cast a shadow across my empty porcelain plate. They were stacked on top of another, making it easy for one to reach over and serve themselves. My mother and grandmother sipped on their tea as they chatted in the gazebo, shading them from the midday sun. 

“It’s been a while since I’ve had a tea party, how joyous.”

“Likewise, Your Grace.”

“How long are you going to keep calling me that? I already gave you permission long ago.” 

My mom paused for a second. “Then, let me call you Lady Rosalyn”

“Hmm, that works too.” She sipped her cup.

Father had left with the Duke to go fix some paperwork, making us three the only ones left. It was surreal. My mom and grandmother, who had the same face as one of my victims, were talking with each other. Her familiar tone of voice made my stomach churn. It rang out with clear intonation as it grazed my ears. It was hard to listen to. The mention of my name made my shoulders flinch.

“Have you planned her debut yet?”

Debut? I heard my mother talk about that once. It was a party of some sort, the intention being to introduce children of a suitable age to society. Debuts in all forms and sizes were hosted all across the kingdom but the most important one was the royal ball. It was there noble children would formally make their appearance and start contributing to their noble house.

“So much has happened that we haven’t had the chance to think about it…”

“Is that so?”

“Besides, debuts aren’t that common for people like us.”

“What a shame it is. I had liked to see her attend the royal ball next year.”

“Your Grace…”

“Why do you sound so sorrowful? Just seeing you three doing so well fills my heart.” Her hand slid across the table surface before finding her cup. She took a sip. 

“Has Galen told you about my proposition?”

My mom slumped her shoulders. “He has.”

“And your answer?”

“Lady Rosalyn, I’m currently living a happy life together with my husband and sweet daughter. Just having them by my side is enough for me.” 

“I see, it must have been too presumptuous of me. It was intended to be my apology, yet I forgot the most important thing.” She straightened out her posture.

“As a Duchess of the Guillain Kingdom, I, Rosalyn Nikodemus, want to formally apologize to you.” She bowed her head, nearly touching the table.

“I am sorry.”

“Your Grace\! You shouldn’t bow your head to someone like me\!” The chair nearly fell as she stood up. 

“Why can’t I apologize to my daughter?”

“Rosalyn…”

“Victoria, you are and will always be one of my precious daughters. Even if we don’t share the same surname, I want you to remember that.” 

She still had her head bowed. “Would you accept this selfish dying woman's apology?”

“Of course\! Please lift your head\!”

She smiled gently

She softened her eyes. “All these years and you are still the same. Thank you dear, my heart feels lighter now.” It dazzled, a golden circle had appeared. 

“I’m happy to hear that, but there’s nothing to apologize for. You didn’t do anything to me.”

“Exactly. I did nothing.” She turned her gaze downwards.

My mom opened her mouth a few times but in the end, nothing was said. Our tea had cooled down, no longer requiring us to blow on it. The only sound I could hear were the rustling trees as the wind shook the leaves. My plate was still empty.

“Would you grant a wish of mine?” My grandmother broke the silence.

“Of course, what is it?”

“Could you ask if Esther would want to have occasional tea parties with me?” 

“Tea parties?”

“You may be too busy to humor me at the estate and I want to get to know my last granddaughter.” 

My mom turned towards me, an expectant look on her face. I didn’t have any real reason to turn down her wish, nonetheless, her gaze staring at me made my eyes flinch. She was staring straight into my eyes. How did she know where my eyes were? 

“It would be an honor, Your Grace.”

“My\! Listen to her talk, did you teach her?”

My mom giggled. “We had ample time on our way to the capital.”

The atmosphere in the estate had gotten livelier, back when we first arrived the servants and maids had a quiet disposition. They talked to each other in a low tone, and their feet shuffled quietly across the floor, as if they had been ordered to not make a sound. Now that the Lady of the house was back at her rightful place, everything turned upside down. 

Light footsteps were heard in the halls, the same with talking and gossip. It was confusing, no one acted as if the Duchess had a month at best of her life. Even the Duchess didn’t act like it as she went around being led by her personal maid greeting everyone. She looked healthy to me. The diagnosis must have been bogus, I thought while walking on the fluffy carpet. My grandmother had invited me to tea today. 

My face muscles were starting to get sore as all the maids I passed smiled at me. We were guests of honor invited by the Duke himself and they had to act appropriately, but this was too much. Luckily I didn’t need to pull my mouth into a smile in front of the Duchess. She couldn’t see afterall. The maid opened the door for me and announced my presence. A leg behind and grab the sides of your skirt. “Good afternoon, Your Grace.” I gave her a curtsy.

“Your manner of speaking astounds me, Esther. How was her curtsy, Alice?” She asked her personal maid.

“It was very elegant, Your Grace. It looked just like young lady Estelle.”

The Duchess’ room was twice the size of mine on the third floor. All the small bits and bobs were nowhere to be seen, making it look rather frugal. Light from the windows lit up the room and the tea table my grandmother was sitting at. 

“Alice, why don’t you show our guest to her seat?”

It was my first time being escorted. My lips curled, I felt like an important person. The cookies in front of me looked freshly baked, still giving off wisps of steam as it. But how should I eat this? There was no knife nor fork to use. 

“We typically use our hands when eating these kinds of desserts.” She picked up a cookie.

I tilted my head. It didn’t feel right to use my fingers, I had gotten used to the feel of utensils. The Duchess was munching on the cookie, not a single crumb fell from her mouth. My right glove laid limply on my lap while my now gloveless hand picked the biggest cookie from the pile. Freshly cooked cookies were now my favorite I decided, after feeling its chewiness between my teeth.

“How is it?”

“It’s really tasty, Your Grace.”

“You can call me grandmother when it’s only us talking.” Her eyes smiled.

Grandmother? That would be difficult. How could I call the woman with that face grandmother? It was fine calling Karrie a friend, because she was. However… I looked to her personal maid for help and she just nodded. 

“Grandmother, may I ask a question?” She wiped her mouth with a napkin. 

“What is it, dear?” Her answer made my body shiver.

“When was the last time you saw me?” 

“Yes, you may not remember, it was a long time ago.” It was the real Esther, not me. “You became fourteen this year? Then it must have been seven years ago when I first saw you.”

My father had appeared in front of the Duke while clutching his ill daughter. It was the first time the Duke saw this unknown granddaughter of his and he went mad. My grandmother said she could still vividly remember how my father begged on his knees while the Duke roared at his son. No other priests could cure Esther, his only hope was the high priest employed for the personal use of house Nikodemus. It worked. Esther had lived until she was thirteen until I took over. 

“It may be better if you don’t remember that memory”, she said.

“Then I will do that”

“I didn’t see the resemblance in the chaos of the situation, but you really do look like Victoria.” It was weird how she kept using phrases involving her eyes. 

“Can you secretly see, grandmother?” She laughed.

“Oh, it’s just a habit of mine, how silly I must seem to be. I lost all vision in my eyes a year ago”, she said. “Now I see nothing even when I open my eyes.” I stared at the golden circle that appeared in front of my face. Wait, she’s not blind? 

Her familiar face had shocked me once already but the appearance of the golden circle really sent me over the edge. Luckily Alice had her face hidden as she served more sweets and tea. I had to close my mouth fast. Wait, didn’t that mean she saw everything? The Duchess was smiling.

My mouth muscles ached as we continued our talk. She told me how my grandfather, the Duke, had always been a stoic man. He had too much responsibility as a subject of the kingdom, but he always meant well, she said. I couldn’t agree. My mom had been constantly spaced off in the air or cried in her sleep. A key lime pie crumbled in my mouth as I watched my grandmother regale her stories. It tasted bittersweet.

The tea party ended and I went to explore more of the estate. The paintings last time were interesting to look at, maybe I should find more of them. A young maid roamed the halls, busily dusting the wall mounted lamps. 

She poked her cheek with a finger. “Paintings? Maybe the portrait room? Do you want me to show you the way?” 

And so I followed her as she led me to a room full of portraits. Most of them were covered with a white cloth but the ones starting from the current Duke could be seen. It immediately stuck out to me how my father’s portrait was nowhere to be seen. 

The portraits showed the current living members of the Nikodemus family. The duke had three children, including my father. They all had black hair. My uncle had two children and my aunt also had two. They too, had black hair. 

I had been proud of my golden hair, it was pretty and it looked like mom’s. But at this moment, seeing all of the portraits have jet-black hair, I felt bitter. Was my hair color why father and mother didn’t want to come here? There was a faint outline on the wall, it was where my father’s portrait should have been.

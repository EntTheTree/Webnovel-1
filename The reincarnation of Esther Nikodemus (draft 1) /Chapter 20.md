# Chapter 20

A week had passed since the people in the state was told that the baroness had run away. In those days, I have done nothing. No more lessons took up my spare time, the Duke was looking for a new tutor, and my parent’s were always hovering over me. It felt nice.

Sitting in the shaky carriage did not feel nice. The idea of finally leaving the estate had made me forget how my body would react. 

“Ugh…”

“Tsk, a little shaking and you’re already this exhausted.”

“Maybe the roads should be better maintained then.”

My father and grandfather looked exactly the same as they crossed their arms at each other. We were visiting the church today. 

The one in Barre did not even compare to this one in the capital. Several people streamed through the main entrance like fish

The one in Barre did not even compare to this one in the capital. Like fish in a river, all sorts of people streamed through the main entrance looking for a spot to settle in to. Meanwhile, with the Duke in the lead, a priest personally leaded us through a side door. Right before entering, he split up, going with the priest instead of us. 

“Shall we find a seat too?” Holding my mom’s hand the three of us found ourself in the upper seats, right behind the other nobles.

Holding their hand-fans to their mouth, chatter and gossiping began coming from them when they settled themselves in their not so church-like clothes. Extravagent dresses with flowing vibrant colors, sparkling necklaces inlaid with diamonds and gems and tall hats. They blocked my view from seeing the statue of the goddess, but it irritated me nonetheless. 

My mom had been worried that morning when it was decided to be a trip to the church. She personally picked out my clothes and helped me into them, something the maids had done while staying here. It had felt a bit awkward at first, but as many other things, I got used to it. Like this frilly dress for example.

I looked like a doll today, only thing missing was a cute smile. Trying to turn my mouth corners up only made me look grumpy. 

“How do you feel?” 

“I’m fine, mom. Look.” I flapped my arms for her to see, my frills waving with the sudden motion. Honestly, they felt a bit sore.

“Do you want to take your hat with you?” She picked up the white sun hat I had been using for the past year.

“Isn’t it rude to wear a hat inside a church?” Had been what I’ve asked and seeing the real life example gave me the answer.

The tall red hat turned to the other. “Another sunday, another church assembly. How many times have it been now?”

“More than we can count on our fingers and toes.” The shorter hat answered, making them give out a ‘ho ho’ and ‘ha ha’. 

Then it went quiet, the head priest had entered. He too, had a hat. A tall one that looked to be half his height, either he was short or the hat was tall but it didn’t help me to think that the taller one’s hat was in church, the higher status one held. I blanked out.

Before I knew it, people had begun rising from their seats and we had headed out. 

“Want to go eat something sweet?” I glanced at the knights standing at attention around us. They gave off an intimidating air with their scabbards on the ready. Although mom didn’t seem to care as she gave me a bright smile.

She said father and grandfather would take a while to go through their business and it wasn’t often the two of us had enough leisure to explore some shops. And so the two of went on our merry way, an entourage of knights following discreetly after us.

The interior of the shop was half-filled with women of all ages sitting around their tables and chatting. There was even a table with some scruffy men, oh, those were the knights.

Mom was holding the menu listing the different desserts. It looked surprisingly modern, this would be popular in my previous life, I think. 

“What do you want to choose?” Eight different titles were written on the leaflet, but they didn’t make sense for me. Ganache? Meringue? I had no idea what any of it meant.

“There’s so much to choose from… can you choose for me?”

“In that case, why don’t we celebrate today\!” A server came up to our table.

“What will it be, madam?”

My mom pointed at the top of the menu and dragged her finger down to the bottom of the page. “We will have everything.” The server stood frozen for a bit before taking our order.

“Will that be alright?” She looked at me and her. Two people couldn’t finish eight plates of desserts, must be what she thought.

“It’s fine, it’s not everyday you get to taste such an array of fine desserts” The server excused herself and dissapeared.

The desserts finally got served and made the spacious table look cramped. It looked like a rainbow had set itself on the table, five colorful slices of cake lit up 

The server came back with a tray and placed down our desserts. It looked like a rainbow had exploded on the table. Five colorful slices of cake, all different from eachother, filled my vision all the while three plates of cookies in various shapes and sizes dotted my periphery. This had to be to much.

It wasn’t. My mom and I had polished all the plates. Even the server looked astonished as my mom gently patted her mouth with a napkin. Doing the same, I saw several crumbs that had gotten caught in my napkin.

“I can feel my soul healing.” My mom went on to tell me what each of the desserts names were and what it all meant. Her hair fluttered prettily as the sun streaming in from the windows got caught by her hair. It was sparkly.

“Haa… these nouveau riche nobles are utterly lacking in class.” Someone sighed from our neighboring table. I recognized their hats. 

“What can you expect from commoners that only thinks of money? Of course they won’t be able to think of something else.”

“You have come up with a fine point there milady.” Two snapping sounds from their fan were followed by a grating laughter. My mom’s hand stopped in the air right before cutting into the ten layer cake. 

“But to think we have to share the floor with them, this establishment doesn’t know who it should cater to.”

“Indeed.” Mom had started to smile wider. I looked similar to the smile Raviel had tried to teach me. With no one to tutor me, after the dissapeance of Baroness Bayonne, Raviel took up the mantle. Her lessons appeared to fit my personality as she had found my progress the following days. The only thing left was how to talk and act like a noble.

“Remember, you must never say what you truly want. Like a hunter circling its prey, you have to gradually hover around the main point until it gets exhausted and collapses, right there in the spot you want it.” What a weird metaphor… “Never say what you wan’t outright.”

“Why not? That sounds stupid.” 

“Miss, you shouldn’t use scathing words like stupid either.”

“What if I see something or someone stupid then?” Raviel sat across from me thinking about my question. Her blue hair moved when she found the answer.

“Then just smile at them. Like this.” 

My mom looked my way and raised her voice. “Ha… to think that such rich people have the free time and energy to sit on the same floor as us. Why can’t they just use their abundance of money to reserve the upper floor for themselves? ” She cut down onto the slice making the plate let out a ringing clack. The two of them had definately heard that as I watched them from the side of my eye. 

“Look at her speak, they truly only think about money.” Her voice wasn’t as cheerful as before. “There are other things in life you know?” She was talking at her cafe partner.

“Yes, things in life such as tasting every type of dessert this establishment has to offer. How would one form an opinions if they could only taste half of it?” She glanced at the plates on their table. “Apologies, half of the meny had been too generous.”

Slam\! “The gall\!” The tallest hat had stood up slamming her table. “Who are you to speak about my finances\!” The employees seemed at a loss on what to do darting their eyes as the other cafe-goers began to murmur. 

Even with her huffing and puffing right beside us. Mom still didn’t turn her head towards her. “Someone who at least doesn’t use a hat popular six or seven years ago.” She simply sipped her tea. 

She stomped over to us. “You\!—”

“Milady\! Calm yourself\!” Her partner held her back. 

“Let me go\! I have to give her a piece of my mind\!” 

“I understand, but please take the situation in consederation\!” She pleaded with the enraged woman. The soft murmurs had developed into fully blown chatter as words like ‘nobles’ and ‘useless pride’ flew around.

Mom sneered as the other woman left in a hurry. I had no idea what just happened but it was amazing. 

“Sorry about that sweetie… I couldn’t just let her blabber her mouth.”

“Mom, you are so cool. I think I understand what Lady Raviel meant now. ”

“Ha ha, you think so?” She was glowing. 

We left the shop and found ourselves sitting the the duchy’s park. 

“The weather is so nice today…” She was nodding off. Sitting with my sleeping mom was enjoyable in itself, however I wanted to move my body after eating so much sugar. A pond was glistened in the distance and so I went. The thumping of the guards feet followed after me. 

A pondy smell filled my nose as I crouched at the edge of it. There were some frogs hopping and ribbiting about under my shadow. Poking at them with a stick didn’t seem to disturb their storic behaviours. Somthing stood behind me, blocking casting a shadow across my view.

“Is that fun?” Whipping my head around a boy stood agaisnt the background of the sun, almost making his blonde-platinum hair look like it was glowing. I had to squint my eyes to see his half-smile.

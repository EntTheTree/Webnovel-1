# Chapter 20

A week had passed since the people in the state was told that the baroness had run away. In those days, I have done nothing. No more lessons took up my spare time, the Duke was looking for a new tutor, and my parent’s were always hovering over me. It felt nice.

Sitting in the shaky carriage did not feel nice. The idea of finally leaving the estate had made me forget how my body would react. 

“Ugh…”

“Tsk, a little shaking and you’re already this exhausted.”

“Maybe the roads should be better maintained then.”

My father and grandfather looked exactly the same as they crossed their arms at each other. We were visiting the church today.

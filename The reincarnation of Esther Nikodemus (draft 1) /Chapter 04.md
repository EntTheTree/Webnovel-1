# Chapter 4: Playing

“Well I see you still make bad jokes…” She sighed.

“That sounds fun, let's try it\!” Eric agreed to the game I said on impulse. “Maybe we can help her remember things.”

“And what if she only chooses dare?”

“I didn’t think that far…”

The magic circle had dissipated. It had slowly faded into the air into nothingness, letting me speak again. I didn’t really want to play this game, it was never fun, but I figured I could use this opportunity to investigate whether that was Ann or not. She wouldn’t be able to figure out who I am, my face and body was completely different. I don’t think I even need to lie or tell the truth this time.

“Let’s play truth or dare then.”

Eric nodded. “Yes\! You can start, Esther, since you were the one who chose it.”

I turned to Karrie. “Truth or dare.” She picked ‘truth’.

“Is it true that your favorite color is red?” 

“Yes, how did you know?” I shrugged. There was no golden circle this time.

“Okay, my turn. Eric, truth or dare?” 

“I will pick dare of course.” He looked confident.

“I dare you to climb that tree over there, give me a leaf.” The tree she pointed at was at least two stories high. 

“Pfft\! That’s easy\!” Eric stood in front of the tree, its width as high as he was tall. He climbed the tree as fast as he went down, holding a big leaf in his hand.

“Here you go.” He handed the leaf to an open-mouthed Karrie.

“What\! How did you do that\! That was so fast\!” She bounced up and down excitedly.

“Hmm hmm, I’m the fastest in this town you know?” Eric puffed out his chest as Karrie and I showered him with praises. Then he picked me to choose ‘truth or dare’. I picked ‘truth’ of course, my body was getting sore.

“Whats your mother’s favorite food?” Her favorite food that’s easy. Carrot stew.

“...\!” What? Why did it show up?

“\!\!\!”

“You don’t remember? I didn’t know it was that bad…”

“No wait, it’s …” No way.

“Esther, you shouldn’t push yourself that hard.” Karrie seemed concerned. Why would *she* look concerned? 

“I know it\! I just can’t say it\!

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I tried to say something else but it didn’t let me. It just blocked my mouth and dazzled. The thing couldn’t even be touched.

I heard them whisper. “Eric, maybe we should change games, she looks really angry…”

“Yeah…” Why were they whispering?

“Esther, how about we play something else?” I see how it is, just because I can’t answer your stupid questions you want to change the game?

“No\! I want to play truth or dare\!” You were always like this.

“Uhm, how about we change the question then, Eric can you-”

“Why should he change his question\! Stop getting in my way\!”

“Esther, I changed my question.”

“Shut up\! The answer is—”

“What is your favorite food”

“—carrot soup\!” What? 

Only the background noise of rustling trees and kids playing could be heard as I tried to understand what had just happened. They just stood there.

“What? My favorite food is carrot soup?” 

“Eshter, are you really okay? I know you always get sick but maybe you should rest for a bit?”

“Okay…” Karrie was looking at me just like Victoria did and Eric hadn’t said anything ever since I yelled out my favorite food. I dragged my body toward the tree Eric had climbed, and took a seat in its shadow. It was cold. I hugged my knees to try to warm up a bit.

The two of them ended up playing with the other kids for a while, before coming back to check up on me. Eric had offered another piece of candy to which I accepted, however it didn’t taste that sweet this time, it was just, sour.

“Do you want to play rock paper scissors?” Karrie suggested. 

I must have really looked terrible if we had to resort to playing that. She bounced her hand two times and on the third bounce, I threw out scissors. 

“I win.” Karrie had thrown out paper, she always did that.

“Let me join the next round.” Eric smiled again.

We sat under the tree and played a couple more rounds. Throwing out my hand this much had warmed up my body a bit. The bell rang in the distance as I noticed the sun hanging a little lower than it did before. 

“Aw shucks, I lost” Eric threw himself down on the grass, laying on his back.”

“You’re really good at this Esther. It was like you already knew what we were going to throw.” Karrie said. 

“Are you saying I know magic?” Eric didn’t have a poker face and I already knew Karrie’s thought pattern. “You guys sound like sore losers.” 

“You know magic?” Eric said from below, ignoring that last part.

“I don’t think I do. How can you check?”

“You just know it?” I thought back on the dozen golden circles. Was that magic? 

“A priest should know if they use their magic on you.”

“Can I be healed if I have magic?”

“Of course you can”, Karrie said. “Healing magic works on everyone, I heard your body shines in your favorite color if you have the ability to use magic\!”

“But nothing has shined from my body yet…” She drooped her shoulders.

“You know a lot about magic, Karrie. Did you want to be one?” Eric looked at her.

“Of course\! Who wouldn’t want to be a cool mage.”

“I would rather be a knight.”

“That’s because you are stupid.”

He flew up from the ground. “I’m not stupid\!”

“Yes you are\! That's why she won\!”

While they were having their little squabble, the other kids had already wrapped up their games and left the plaza. I began to also leave, dragging my feet toward the meeting point Victoria had told me. I missed her. The two others began following me as I approached the alleys, they all looked the same. 

“Esther”, Eric called out.

“What is it?”

“Thats the wrong way. The fountain is this way.” I saw him smirk.

“Oh, I thought you were taking a shortcut, Esther. So sorry.” My cheeks felt hot as I turned and followed them instead.

With Eric leading the way, the three of us began our journey through the alleys. Chatting along the way were the two of them, their topics ranged from this to that. Occasionally, I gave an affirmative “Yes” or “I see” pretending to listen as I focused all my strength in my feet instead. They were beginning to hurt.

“Hey did you hear about the Executioner? How dead people keep popping up?” I turned my ears towards Eric.

“I did see that there were more guards than usual lately, is that why?” 

“Finn said that his dad would give a huge reward to the person that caught him.” 

“Really? Why doesn’t he just catch them himself? Isn’t he the captain?” Karrie put her hand to her chin. “How much are we talking about?”

“He said thirty gold coins\!” Eric gestured with his hands.

“Oh my goddess.” Was that a huge sum? “And you really believed him?”

“Well…”

She shrugged. “I can’t remember the last time that daddy’s boy said something that was true.”

“You do have a point.” He copied Karrie’s hand gesture.

The fountain came into view as we rounded the corner. Victoria was already there with Gale, the two of them talking to a woman. She wore pants, which I hadn’t seen a woman use in a while, and a big cape. Her light blue hair was also cut short, only reaching her chin. She looked pretty with that unusual hairdo.

“Miss Victoria\!” Karrie shouted. “We brought Esther back”

Having heard her name being called, she turned toward us three. She smiled when her gaze met mine. I could hear Eric mumble my mothers name in front of me. Tsk.

“Goodness, there’s a whole group of you now.” 

“Oh my, how cute. Are these all your children?” The short haired woman asked.

“As if, one is more than enough for us.” Gale crouched down, meeting me at my eye level. “Did you make new friends already today?”

“Yeah, this is Eric and Karrie. But I think Karrie was already my friend.”

The woman looked at me and then at my mother. “The resemblance is uncanny. Nice to meet you, I’m Raviel.” She gave me a bow. 

“Hello, I’m Esther, I live out of town. I’m thirteen.” I bowed back, which got a chuckle out of her. Was there something funny?

“I suppose it is time for the children to head back, should we meet again to finalize the contract?” Gale confirmed and Raviel left us, blending through the crowd of people.

“Aw shucks, I’m gonna get scolded again\! Bye guys, and see you Lady Victoria\!” Eric left while waving toward my mother.

“Lady Victoria? Did that boy just..?” Yes he did, Gale.

My mother waved back. “What a charming boy.” 

“Karrie, did you go out alone again? Do you want to head back with us today?” Karrie glanced shyly at my mother and nodded.

With Karrie and I at the front, we began our journey back home. It was amazing how much Karrie could talk. My ear nearly fell off, still at least she looked happy chatting away. If only she could hear my inner turmoil.

Was Ann or Karrie? She wasn’t Ann at the moment, yet her face was. It was fun playing with them today, I had a good time. *It wouldn’t hurt to just observe her*. Her mouth was opening and closing rapidly, letting the words flow out.

We finally arrived at her house. It looked similar to ours, which stood there in the distance, even the tree in the backyard stood in a similar position.

“See ya Esther\! I will definitely win next time, let’s play again\!”

My parents said farewell to her mother, who had come outside to scold her tomboy daughter. They seemed to know each other well, promising to visit should there be time for it. 

“Was she one of those people who had that idea you were talking about?”

He adjusted the grip on the bag of stuff. “Raviel?” Gale explained that Raviel’s employer had apparently found a treasure map of some kind and needed some experienced people that knew the lay of the land. He boasted that no one knew this place better than him. The employer had apparently found him because of this boasting. 

I don’t know about this idea of hers, doesn’t it sound suspicious? Such a high sum just to guide some people…”

“That’s just how they are. How about this?” He took her hand. “I will tell my men to immediately run should I sense anything dangerous. This job is too lucrative to give up.” He planted a kiss on the back of her hand. 

“I’m really sorry for making you always do all this work…”

“Nothing to be sorry about, I married you didn’t I?” I saw my mother blush while the red evening sun shone behind her.

Getting tucked in by my mother became a routine of sorts after I moved rooms. Although it still felt awkward as I laid there, hiding half of my face under the blanket, while she looked over me.

“Did you have fun today?” I nodded.

I had made a commotion when my legs suddenly gave out and Gale had to carry me the rest of the way. She had fretted around the house blaming herself for not taking better care of me. It wasn’t until her husband comforted her saying that none of it was her fault. A child had to fall down to learn how to pick themself up, he said. My mother patted my belly as she sat there with a gentle expression. 

“I played truth or dare today.”

“Really?”

“But it wasn't any fun… So we played rock paper scissors instead.” My eyes felt heavier as Victoria kept patting my belly. 

“I won, they didn’t even have a chance.”

“Of course my daughter won. Why, she must be the best at rock paper scissors in the world.” She gave my forehead a kiss.

Her mood always changed whenever something happened to me. Happy when she saw that I finished my meal. Sad when I looked exhausted from moving around. It was apparent even to me how much she loved her daughter. I wonder what I have to do to not make her make that sad expression anymore.

She left the room when I could no longer open my eyes. A lot had happened today. I ate grilled meat, stole– ate some candy Eric had given me, and met Karrie. It was honestly shocking seeing her but she was fun to be around. It had been a long time since I've had fun with others. 

A sudden realization shook off my drowsiness as I opened my eyes wide. Laying on top of my desk was my coin pouch, it still had a silver coin in it. I forgot to spend my money\! Tomorrow, I would spend some money tomorrow, whatever it took.

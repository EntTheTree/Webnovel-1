# Chapter 2

I could hear the front door open downstairs and a manly voice rang out. My mother was talking to him when suddenly footsteps sprinted up the stairs.

“Esther\!” A man barged into the room. The first thing I noticed were his clothes. Leather armor outfitted with metal plates and clinking on his belt was a genuine sword.

“Oh, I shouldn’t have left you\!” He held my hand, pressing it against his head as he knelt by the bed. I could smell something familiar coming from him. It was a smell I knew all too well; the smell of blood.

“Are you my father?”

“Oh my Goddess it was true\!” His eyebrows scrunched together as he seemed ready to cry. Not expecting him to answer, I looked toward my mother for the answer. She had entered the room after him and was consoling her husband. 

“Say hello to your father, dear.” 

He was a handsome man. His sharp jawline was devoid of hair and his obsidian eyes were looking at me warmly under his jet-black hair. 

My mother explained to him how after he left for the expedition, she had to call over a priest to heal me. And as it did not work, she had nearly given up hope, before I opened my eyes.

My mother explained to him what had happened after he had left for the expedition. How the priest had said to prepare for a ritual right before I opened my eyes. 

“I knew those people were quacks\!” He bellowed.

“Watch what you are saying\!” 

“How else wouldn’t healing magic not work\! They must have sent an unqualified priest\!” He looked like one of the demon paintings I had seen in the temple. 

“I don’t know either, but please calm down”, she pleaded with him. It was only then that he noticed the situation. He hadn’t even taken his armor off.  
He took a moment to collect himself. “So she doesn’t remember anything?”

“That’s right she didn’t even remember me…” Victoria couldn’t stop her emotions from surfacing, breaking out into a sob.

“Oh honey, come here”, now it was the wife’s turn to be consoled.

I watched them absentmindedly. My heart grew heavy with guilt. Esther, are you watching? How am I supposed to act in this situation?

A new day welcomed me as the rays of sun lit up the room and woke me up. A pleasant smell of plants filled the room. My mother had fallen asleep while watching over me again. She looked exhausted, although the smile on her sleeping face indicated otherwise. Sitting there under the light, the dust being lit looked like stars circling around her.

I better get better soon.

From the conversations I could hear the last few days, the main topic seemed to be about money. The priest had refused payment, stating that he couldn’t accept payment for something the Goddess herself did. But our funds were trickling out with the amount of medicine being bought. 

Feeling particularly well in this body today, I decided to snoop around the house a bit. Sneaking past my mother, I went out of the room, careful not to wake her up. The first thing I wanted to see was a mirror. I still haven’t seen myself. I figured the most likely place other than this room would be Esther’s bedroom. I had actually been using my parents’ room ever since I woke up.  

Opening the door, a cozy room greeted me. A bed half the size of the one I’ve been using, a desk with a matching chair under a window pointing towards the forest in the distance. I searched around the desk and found some books placed haphazardly on top. They were all about plants and their effects on the body. Although I had never seen the alphabet being used in these books, I could still understand their meaning. Was this a form of magic?

Feeling tired, I waddled out of Esther’s room and went back into bed, having not achieved my goal. 

Victoria woke up and stretched her arms toward the air. “Good morning, sweetie. Did you sleep well?” Her headpats always felt oddly pleasant.

I nodded.

“It looks like your dad is cooking something good.” A delicious scent had filled the house while I did my investigation.

Reflected in the puddle was a face resembling Victoria staring absentmindedly at me. She was pretty. 

My body had gotten much better the past week with all the rest and food. Today I finally got permission to venture outside. Yesterday’s rain had wet the garden, covering every blade of grass with droplets. 

“Esther\!” Victoria was calling from the kitchen window, “Want to give me a hand with breakfast?”

“Coming\!”

Standing up still got me a bit lightheaded, which had become familiar by now.

It was yesterday that mom suggested I help her with cooking by cutting some vegetables. She probably suggested that seeing that all I did was lie in bed reading the few books available. 

“Here cut these carrots into cubes, want me to show you how it’s done?”. It seemed she had gotten used to my amnesia, often asking me whether I knew something or not.

“I think I got it”

It had been a while since I last held a knife. Gripping it with each of my fingers wrapping around the handle, I felt the weight of the knife in my hand. I couldn’t help but involuntarily frown a little. This was a terrible knife.

“Is it too heavy?” My mother seemed to misunderstand my inner thoughts. 

“No, it should be fine.” It was not fine. The balance point was in an unideal position, making one use more energy than needed. And not to mention the nicks on the edge of the blade. 

Despite my inner complaints, I still made quick work on the carrots, cutting them into suitable pieces. I had eventually taken over the kitchen while living in the temple. I had originally wanted to just make something to give the monks, but upon seeing my knifework, asked me to help in the kitchen whenever I had time. 

“Did you get better at cutting vegetables?” Did I show too much?  
“You must have gotten it from me, my daughter is so talented\!” She couldn’t help but gush and gave me a squeeze.

“Mom, I’m holding a knife.” Mom, mom, mom. I don’t think I will ever get comfortable saying that three-letter word.

“Sorry, sorry, you’re just so lovely\!”

“Are these stars?” Victoria studied one of my pieces. “Pretty cute…”

“I think they taste better as stars.” I placed the knife down.

“Hmm”, she pondered my statement. “Come here\!” 

A full on hugging attack. 

“How is my daughter this cute\!” Sometimes, I don't really understand Victoria. Nonetheless, whenever she hugged me I couldn’t help but feel a bit happier. 

Setting the table for three, my father came down the stairs groggily.

“What’s for breakfast today?” He asked, slumbering toward his seat at the end.

“Vegetable stew and fried potatoes”. We were now all seated. “Phew, you better wash up afterwards. I can practically smell the alcohol coming from you, how many did you have yesterday”

“I didn’t even get to take a sip, some guy spilled his whole cup all over me”. He lifted his spoon toward his mouth. “Wow, is it just me or did your cooking get better lately?”

“It’s a secret ingredient I found lately”, my mother smirked mischievously, as he inhaled the bowl of stew.  

“Poison is it?”

“What nonsense\! Why would I poison the same food as Esther and I are eating”

“She didn’t deny it…”, my father murmured to me.

“What you are tasting is the talents of your daughter. She has helped me in the kitchen lately.”

“Really? She did feel more mature lately, but to think my child is now all grown up…”, fake-wiping his fake tears, he gave me a few pats. 

“I should give a gift to my now all grown up daughter, say it and it shall become yours”, he said theatrically, eliciting a chuckle out of his wife.

“I don’t really need anything”

“She really did go and grow up…” Father slumped his shoulders. “How about this?” Rummaging through his pockets, he pulled out a silver coin. 

“Isn’t that a bit much, honey? You could buy a day’s worth of food with that”

“And that’s not all”, leaving the table, he came back with a book in hand.

“I heard you were interested in monsters.” It was a monster lexicon.

“Whoah, thanks\!” I could finally see what the monsters looked like.

“So my daughter likes monsters more than money, noted”

“Where do you keep finding these books? Aren’t they expensive?”

“Don’t worry, I got this for less than that silver coin”

Flipping through a few pages, I understood why my mother didn’t worry too much about her husband going out and slaying monsters. Each page had a picture and a description of a monster. A rabbit with antlers, a deer with four eyes and other animals with an assortment of features either added or subtracted. Well, I guess you could call these weird beasts monsters.

“Speaking of which, you know the people I met yesterday? They had a really good job offer for us. I’m sure a lot of money will be paid out.”

“Really? Who are they?”

He explained how some people from out of town had come here to find something, and needed people to show them the way. They wouldn’t give more details until they finalized the contract. 

“We won’t have to worry about money for a while if my gut instinct is correct\!”

“This sounds too good to be true”, my mother seemed suspicious, “I’ve never heard of guarding duty being well paid”

“Well, by the way she was acting, it seemed like the leader was a noble. *I* would know”

“That makes sense…”

I guess nobles need more protection than necessary. Anyway, how should I spend this silver coin?

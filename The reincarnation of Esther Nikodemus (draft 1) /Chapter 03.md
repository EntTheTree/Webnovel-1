# Chapter 3: Town

“Hey kid, you want to buy something?”

I was currently standing in front of a toady looking street vendor selling meat skewers. The smell of the skewers had enchanted me, making me arrive at this place. It had been a while since I’ve eaten grilled meat.

“Go ask your parents if you’ve got no money”

“How much for a skewer?” My mother had given me a coin pouch to safely carry the silver coin. It was hand-sewed and the name, Esther, was embroidered on it. 

“Five coppers for one, kid.” 

I was about to open my pouch when I saw something glistening in front of the toady man's mouth. It looked like a circle.

“Sorry, could you repeat that?”

“A kid your age already losing their hearing? I said five, coppers.” A golden circle was hovering in front of the man’s mouth, appearing as if to cover it. The golden circle appeared each time he told me the price.

“What about this one?” I pointed to a skewer with only vegetables.

“Four coppers, scram if you’re not going to buy anything.” It appeared again when he said four. Only I seemed to see it.

“Are you lying about the price?”

The vendor paused for a second. “Lying about the price? Who decided that?”

“Do you want me to buy you one sweetie?” My mother had arrived.

“How much for a skewer?”

“That’ll be three coppers for one.” 

I felt my eyebrows scrunch together as I held the skewer in my hand. Did the toady vendor really lie? Like he said, who decided what was a lie? The golden circle had to be some form of magic. This was too confusing.

Taking my first bite of the skewer filled me with amazement. A bit gamey, but that  only added to the charm. The temple didn’t have that much meat to eat and this tasted different from the dishes Victoria made. 

“Is this meat from the four-eyed deer monster?” I asked her

“You can’t really eat monsters, sweetie.”

“Why not?” I took another cube of meat  into my mouth.

“Monsters were poisoned by the goddess to make it so we wouldn't needlessly hunt them.”

“Really?” I put the last cube in my mouth. “Wouldn’t it be better to hunt them for food?”

“Who knows? Maybe we can ask one of the priests at the church.”

She went on to explain that the church in town was the place to ask about the goddess, the divine or anything monster related. A church didn’t sound like a place where I would be comfortable at. It’s a wonder how I managed to even stay at a temple.

With two empty skewers in one hand, and my mother’s hand in the other, I accompanied her wherever she led me. The sight of the town was quite something. It looked just like a medieval city. Cobblestones laid on our path and carriages with horses could be seen going up and down the streets, clipping and clopping all the while. Passing a bunch of people, we arrived in front of a shop.

The town was pretty developed for being a town on the outskirts, Gale said. There was a social class system used in the Kingdom where the aristocracy held more power than the commoners. At the top of the social pyramid stood the King, he could have ruled the kingdom with an iron fist doing whatever he wanted, hadn't it been for the nobles. The highest ranking nobles were the three dukes who, with the help of several different aristocratic factions, held the king and each other in check. Gale had let out a huge sigh when he had explained.

The noble ruling over this town was Baron Barre, which was also the name of the town. Barre of the Guillain Kingdom. It rolled nicely off the tongue. Gale didn’t seem that happy when talking about him.

“Why don’t you wait on the bench here?” She pointed to a bench set outside the store, shaded by a big leafy tree.

My legs had begun to ache so it was a welcome offer. Sitting on the bench and watching the people walking past me was entertaining enough. There were some guards walking around with spears in their hand patrolling the area, people who were haggling with vendors trying to get the most for their money, I should try doing that next time. Yet what had been the most entertaining was the striking hair colors of the people in this town. Red, blue, green, a bunch of colors littered the heads of the passerbys. Speaking of, a boy with red hair had appeared in front of me.

“What’s a young lady like you doing here? Never seen you here before.”

A young lady, wasn’t that usually used when talking to nobles? Well I did wear a rather pretty dress and fancy sunhat. Victoria had given me one of hers to protect me from the scorching summer sun. Anyway, who is he?

The boy had a tall frame with tanned skin, evidence of him having played outside a lot. He still had some boyness to him as his face didn’t look like a man yet. His green eyes stared at me and his unkempt red hair looked like a hedgehog I had seen once.

“I’m not a young lady, my name is Esther. I’ve never seen you before either”

“Is that so? I’m Eric, I live in that house over there”, he said, pointing at the house next to the shop. “I’m 14”

Is this how you are supposed to introduce yourself?

“I live outside town, I’m 13”

He smirked. “Looks like I’m older than you”

“Are you lost or something?” 

“I’m waiting for my mom.”

“That sounds boring.” The boy took a seat beside me as if it was natural, plopping himself down. He was a whole head higher than me.

“Yeah this is boring, wanna go play instead?” It hadn’t even been a full minute before he said something. 

“My mother said to not go with strangers.” 

Victoria didn’t tell me this but the point still stands, I think. *She* didn't really exude a sense of confidence. Besides, playing? That did sound fun.

“I’m not a stranger, I know your name and you know mine. Oh I know.” He rummaged through his bag, eventually pulling something wrapped in paper.

“My dad told me to give a gift to someone to make them your friend. Here take one”

It was hard-candy. I hadn’t had sugar in a while, it was supposed to be pretty rare so how did this kid get some? Not passing up this opportunity, I unwrapped one and popped it into my mouth. My mouth felt like it was burning as the sweetness enveloped my mouth. 

He smiled. “There, we’re now friends”

“Is that how that works?” I snuck another piece into my mouth.

“Hey, don't take all of them\!” Tsk, he took them away.

“Don’t click your tongue at me…”

“Who’s this, Esther? A new friend?” My mother was finished with her shopping.

“Yeah, he gave me some candy".

“Did he now? Well thank you for that”. Victoria gave him a smile.

“O-oh it was no problem, my lady. My name is Eric. I live over there”. He was already on his feet, his face turning red like his hair.

“Oh my\! My lady?” She looked happy.

He had a dumb expression on his face. “Mom, can I go play with Eric for a bit?”

“Hmm” She turned to look at the guards. “Make sure to meet us by the fountain on the next bell, okay? Eric, can I offer you this mission?”

“Of course\!”

“Eric, let's go.”

“Huh? Oh, sure”

Eric went after me after giving my mother a farewell. I saw that she was waving at us when I turned around. My cheeks filled with air as I walked a little bit faster. 

“Hey where are you going, that’s the wrong way”

“Really? I don’t even know where I am going.”

“Weirdo.” Eric gave me a funny look. “This way. All the kids play over there.”

Snaking around some alleys and streets, we arrived into a clearing, where a group of kids were chatting and running around.

“Hey guys\! A brought another one to play with”

“Eric\!” a girl in shorts came running up to us. “I told you to stop bringing over random kids\!”, she said grumpily.

“She’s not some random kid, I befriended her with some candy. Isn’t that fine? She looked pretty bored so I took her along.” Rubbing his nose, it looked like he thought he did something heroic. I wasn’t actually bored.

“That’s not the correct way to befriend someone\!” She sounded exasperated. 

The girl let out a sigh. “Ugh, well what’s done is done. I’m Karrie by the way”. 

My sunhat was blocking me from seeing her face. Tilting my head to move it out of the way, a sight I had not expected greeted me.

“What? What are you doing here?” 

“Ann?”

“Who’s that, I said my name was Karrie.”

“You know her?” Eric asked.

“She’s my neighbor. Did you get sick again? Haven’t seen you around lately.”

Chestnut-brown hair done in a short bob, a pair of brown eyes and above them, two thin eyebrows framing her round face. A vivid image of her laying in a casket filled my head. There was no mistaking it, she had a different name but this was definitely her. 

“Hello? You home?” A hand appeared in front of me, waving back and forth.

“Oh, sorry. Nice to meet you, I’m Esther. I live outside of town”. 

“What kind of greeting is that supposed to be? And I already know who you are.” Tilting her head to the side. Her eyebrows seemed to question me. “Is this some kind of a new joke?”

“Sorry it wasn’t a joke. I lost my memories a few days ago, so I don't remember anyone.”

“Are you joking? How’s that possible”

“I don’t know, the priest said he didn’t know either.”

“You called a priest? Must have been serious then…” She crossed her arms.

“Whoah, that's so cool\!” Jumping into the conversation was a cheerful looking Eric.

“So you don’t remember anything?” I nodded to his question.

“What about your parents, did you remember them?”

“Hey\! What are you saying\!” Seeing her slap Eric on the back resurfaced some old memories. 

“When I woke up, I just saw this pretty lady looking at me.” 

“Yeah that’s right, she’s really pretty\!”. Eric said, rubbing his back. Tsk.

“Hey, stop clicking your tongue at me\! What did I do now?”

Eric continued. “Well? And then what happened?”

“Hey quit it, look how sad she is getting\!”

Sad? Me? Well this works out. The golden magic circle thingy had nagged at me and with Ann popping up, I could investigate them both.

“Ann, do you know what happened on Earth?”

She was silent, only looking at me. 

Her mouth finally opened. “Oh.” Was she also reincarnated? “You were talking to me? I don’t know this erf thing you are talking about, but my name is Karrie.”

No magic circle appeared. How could this be? She was definitely Ann. I couldn’t forget her face even if I wanted to. 

“Are we going to play or what?” Eric said.

“Ah, that’s right, let's do something fun\!” Ann- Karrie said.

“We? You gonna ditch the others?”

“They only do tiring stuff, the weather is too hot today. I don’t want to get sweaty. You know anything interesting to do, Esther?” Right the circle must not be detecting lies after all.

“Esther? Hello?” 

“Oh, sorry, I don’t remember.”

“Wow… I bet you say that often.” Eric said incredulously. Karrie glanced at me and nodded.

Ridiculous as it sounds, it was the truth, or more correctly, I didn’t know any games. Having never had the chance to play with others, remembering games or fun things to do was just wasted energy I could instead use to survive. Well, there was one activity I was often a part of.  

“How about truth or dare?” I spat out.

“You serious?” They said in tandem.

“It was a joke”, was what I wanted to say as an excuse, however before I could let out the words exit my mouth, a golden magic circle had formed in front of it, blocking me from speaking.

She really wasn’t Ann?

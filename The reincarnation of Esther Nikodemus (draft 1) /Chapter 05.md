# Chapter 5: Church

Sitting on the prayer bench, my eyes lost its focus staring at the hand-crafted marble statue. The sides of my dress had become wrinkled by how hard I clenched my hands. Today was the day of the Goddess, the seventh day of the week. 

I had my whole day planned out. First, wear something comfortable. After that, go to town, maybe with Karrie if she wanted to and then use the whole day to go find something interesting to spend my money on. My mother had woken me up as usual, however this morning she told me to get ready for church. I glanced up at the statue of the goddess with her smug expression.

The sight of statues was starting to really annoy me. Did they all really need to make the same face? Why can’t they just be faceless or have a mask on. At least make their eyes closed. The sunlight shone through the stained glass window, draping its colors across the hall. I sat where the red light shone, the perfect spot for the statue to look down at me. My dress would get ripped if I didn’t control myself.

“And onto us the Goddess bestowed these five commands\!” The headpriest doing the sermon shouted something familiar. He was a middle aged man wearing an all white garment, the only other color being the golden scarf thing. A stole I think it was called.

He went on to explain the five rules one had to follow to not be damned: Killing, theft, adultery, lying, and intoxication. What? It was the same as the five precepts the monks used to tell me. Wasn’t it a unique concept? I thought back to what the monks had said to me once.  

“Do you know why drinking is the last thing to be mentioned? That’s because it’s the most important one.” The monk said.

“Why isn’t killing the worst thing? That would make more sense.” 

“Hmm, let me tell you a story then.

There once was a young monk going around begging for food. This was a task assigned by his master as a form of study. It wasn’t a simple task to beg for food. Knocking on the doors of houses, silence would greet him more often than not. 

One time, someone had given the monk a jug of wine, they had no water to give. The monk had never taken a sip of alcohol before, he had been raised in the temple. Feeling thirsty, he took a sip, and then a glug, and finally the whole jug was gone. He felt full.

Walking down the street he was getting hungry from drinking. The young monk spotted a plump chicken in someone’s backyard. Passing through the fence, he took the chicken and slaughtered it. There was a coal grill in the backyard and so he began grilling it. He felt full.

The houseowner heard the commotion in their backyard and angrily yelled at the monk for stealing her chicken. The monk had never seen such a beautiful woman before in his life, and before he knew it, he had committed adultery. He felt full.

Returning back to his temple, the master asked him if he had done something other than go beg for food. No, he replied. The master looked upon the young monk. He felt full of sadness.

“How about it? Do you see why it is mentioned last? A drunk person will easily lose reason and do whatever their inner instincts tell them to do.”

“I don’t know. Would some alcohol really make someone do all that?”

The monk chuckled. “You may still be a bit too young to understand”

\*\*\*

“May you all be blessed\!” The booming voice snapped me out of my thoughts. The sermon had ended and the dozens of people started streaming out of the church. I followed my parents the opposite way.

“What a surprise to see you here today, Mr. Gale. Did something good happen?” The headpriest smiled.

I noticed Gale clench his fist. “Good to see you too, Father.” A big golden circle appeared. I turned to see if the priest saw it, no reaction. 

“We were wondering if we could meet with the priest who paid us a visit a few days ago?”

“Straight to the core of the matter as always.” The priest closed the holy book slowly, not making a sound, then with quiet steps, sauntered around the altar. 

“What’s with the hastiness? How about we chat over a cup of tea?” He motioned to the door at the back. 

“Thank you for the offer, but we don’t want to take up more of your time than necessary”

The priest stood still for a moment, still smiling. “What a shame I just got these new tea leaves, it's not often you get things from the capital here you know?” He paused for a second. 

“You must be talking about Father Lawrence who joined us recently, speaking of which, he consulted with me on an interesting matter of his.” He turned and stared at me. His jovial expression still plastered on his face. 

“Hmm, I see.”

I noticed something gold flicker in his eyes as Gale stepped forward, blocking his sight. 

“Sorry about, a force of habit”. He pulled out a bag from the altar. “Do you want some raisins?”

“No thanks”, I said.

“Like father, like daughter.” He chuckled to himself.

“Well, then. He should be in the library.” The priest opened the door, motioning us to follow.

“He is still unpleasant as ever.” He sighed. “This won’t take long.” Gale left, leaving my mother and I behind.

My mother bent down to talk to me. “Want to go visit the courtyard? I heard they got some new pretty flowers\!”

The smell of flowers tickled my nose as I strolled around the courtyard holding my mothers hand. Roses the size of my hand and other flowers in all kinds of colors lit up the well-trodden path. 

“I wonder if we could take some home with us”, she studied the peonies, “don’t you think it would spruce up our home, Esther?”

I nodded. A golden circle had appeared before my mouth. I hated flowers. I couldn’t care less about them. They cost too much and their fragrant smell made me feel sick. I had seen enough of them already. Maybe I should ask the priest if he knew something about this annoying thing.

We sat on a bench after my mother was done with her flower-gazing. The gray church stood like a castle in the courtyard.

I turned to Victoria “Mom, would you rather I had my memories back?”

“What are you talking about sweetie?” She furrowed her brows.

“Isn’t that why we are at the church? To ask for a cure?”

“Well…” She took a moment to say the next words. “You know we will always love you, right?”

I nodded.

“We just felt that you may be a bit frustrated not knowing all the things your father and I are talking about.”

“I’m not.” I turned away from her gaze. “It’s kinda fun learning new things everyday”.

I didn’t need to look to figure out what expression she had, she had wrapped her arms around me and gave me a hug.

“Esther\!” Someone shouted my name.

“Let’s play\!” It was Karrie, wearing a dress this time. Her pale shoulders peeked above her dress. I got permission to play for a bit and went over to where Karrie was waving. 

“Are you still getting hugs at your age?” 

“What’s wrong with that, I like them.”

“Wow… Gross…” She rubbed her shoulders. “I can’t believe how different you are now…”

“Really, how did I act before?”

“Uhm”, she hesitated, “it didn’t look like you liked you mom that much”

“That’s ridiculous, was I stupid or something?”

“Yeah, I thought so too\! Your mom is ten times nicer than mine.”

Karrie told me more things about Esther, how she behaved, how she talked, and how she never looked to really have fun whenever she played, always having a sad or tired expression on her face. Karrie seemed to like this version of Esther a lot more.

“Hey, let's go find some cool insects.”

“Insects? How do you find them?”

“Oh right, you just need to find a really big rock and lift it.” She motioned with her hands. “I saw some really big ones behind the church\!”

Following her, I turned around and looked at my mother. Her hair was gently swaying in the cool wind and she had her eyes closed with a peaceful expression. I should let her sleep some more.

“This one will do.” Karrie gripped a decently sized rock and turned it over. Dozens of insects scrawled around as their roof had disappeared. A big worm squirmed there on the dirt. It twirled and twirled as if trying to become a ball before deciding to rather be a stick. It was disgusting. Why don’t you just dig in the dirt if you’re getting burned by the sun? You incompetent worm. I’m glad I didn’t reincarnate into this stupid thing. 

I grabbed a nearby stick and stabbed it in its thick part. It went unscathed, my stick only pressing it into the dirt helping it find cover from the sun. I stabbed it again and again. There was a small hole where it had squirmed. It had disappeared. I couldn’t even kill this single insignificant worm. 

“Whoah, look at that beetle\!”

The outside rushed back into my senses. Karrie pointed with a stick at a beetle.

“I bet ya it will stink twice as much”, she said chirpily before upturning rock after rock, looking for an even bigger beetle. I didn’t see how she could enjoy herself.

“What are you dumb girls doing?” Someone interrupted our playing.

Strutting toward us was a tall moss-headed boy and another boy trailing behind him.

“Ugh, it’s Finn and his lackey”

“Who’s that?”

“Someone annoying, just ignore them.” She turned away from them.

“Hey\! I asked you a question\!” Moss-boy demanded

The other boy spoke up. “Bro, why are we even talking to them? Let’s go find some cool sticks\!”

“I don’t care about some dumb sticks\!” He suddenly roared. 

“But you said-” Finn threw his hand over the other boy’s mouth.

Karrie sighed. “What do you want?” Her voice contrasted her earlier cheery tone. 

“You\!” The green boy pointed at her. “Why are you hanging out with Esther?”

“It’s nonya”

“What’s nonya?” The other boy asked.

“None of ya business\!” Karrie guffawed.

“Thats not funny\!” 

Crossing his arms he turned to me. “Esther, you shouldn’t hang out with her.” Who was he to tell me what to do?

“Why not?”

“She’s a bad person\! Don’t you remember how she spread the rumours?”

“What rumours?” 

“Hey\!-” Karrie tried to interrupt him. 

“That you are always pretending\!”

“Stop\!”

“That the only reason we play with you is because you are pretty\!”

I looked toward Karrie, he had spoken the truth.

“Esther, I didn’t really mean to-”

“Yeah right.” Finn interrupted. “You are only pretending to hang out with her aren’t you. You probably have some other evil plan to make Esther sad again. You are a bad person, Karrie.” Karrie looked like a beaten up puppy as he barraged her with comments. He looked proud. That image irritated me, she was my friend.

“You shouldn’t hang out with those types of people.” He reached his hand toward me. 

“I didn’t believe those rumours at all you know?” He lied. 

“You should hang out with someone with a good personality like me instead” His cheeks reddened a little as he said that. 

Is that how it works? He didn’t look like a person with a good personality. Actually, in the short time I saw and heard him, I thought the opposite to be true.

“No thanks.” I said flatly. Finn’s hand dropped a little. “I’d rather play with Karrie.”

“What? Why?” 

“Because you are stupid, and your personality sucks.” Finn and the boy looked shocked. 

“What? Esther, I’m trying to help you out here\!”

“Yeah, Finn is the smartest out of all of us\!” The other stupid boy said stupidly.

“Why are you getting angry? I should be angry at you for even talking to me.”

“Esther…” Karrie said meekly.

“I’m not getting angry\!” The circle dazzled. “My dad said getting angry is only for weak people\!”

“Is that right, then you must be both angry and stupid. And your dad must be stupid too\!” I felt my blood rushing in my veins.

“Don’t call my dad stupid\!” My vision yanked upward towards the sky. The front of my shoulders hurt but the impact on the back of my head made that seem small in comparison. He had shoved me to the ground. 

“Hey\! Why did you do that\!”

“I-I didn’t mean to\!”

“Bro, let's just get out of here\!” 

They scurried away while I grabbed my head. I’ve had enough. Everything irritated me. Irritating statues, irritating gold circles, and irritating people. 

I turned to Karrie standing above me. She was shouting at them. “You cowards\! Why are you running\! Come back here\!”

“Karrie.”

“Oh, Esther, are you okay?” She had a conflicted expression on her face as she helped me up.

“I’m really sorry…” 

“Why are you sorry? They should be the ones saying sorry.” My voice growled.

“It’s my fault you got pushed… and I said those things about you…”

I stared into her downcast eyes. “Karrie, the truth is, I’m not the real Esther. So you don’t need to feel guilty for what you said about her.”

Karrie’s eyes blew up like a pair of plates.

“What?” She looked shocked. 

“What a bad joke…”

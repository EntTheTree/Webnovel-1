# Chapter 21

I kept poking the dull frogs. “It’s interesting.” 

“I don’t think they like getting poked at?” 

“I highly doubt that. Look they are not even moving.” It’s glassy eyes did not contain a single shred of a care as I continued to poke at it. I was getting a bit irritated for some reason. Besides, it’s not as if I could kill them anyway.

“Could you move? You’re blocking the sun.” He had been standing with resting his hands on his knees while looking at me. Getting a better look at him, he really gave off an air of importance. He wore a simple shirt that was free of wrinkles and stains, the pure white shirt was making my eyes tired by how bright it was. His hair was neatly cut, the tips curling into themselves as they sat on the top of his head. 

“You don’t look like the sort of person that enjoys the sun.” His eyes gravitated towards my pale arms sticking out of my clothes. 

I stood up, making him do the same. He was a head taller than me. “Don’t you think it’s a bit rude for you to be saying that?” 

“Haha, people do often say that my comments are sometimes rude. I didn’t mean anything by it.” The corners of his mouth went a little higher. “I’m TKprincename may I have yours?” He bowed like a gentleman, not even hiding the fact that he was some sort of noble. Although his name seemed to be a lie. The golden circle meshed with his appearence making my eyes squint even more.

Drawing my leg back and pinching the hem of my skirt, I gave him a curtsy. “I’m Esther, I won’t tell you my age however.” Raviel told me giving one’s age, especially a lady’s was not something you should do. 

“Interesting.” He rubbed his chin. “I thought I knew all the noble children residing in the capital.” What did he mean by that? Should I run? Where are the guards? It was quiet. The surroundings was too quiet. Ribbits and occasional bird cries filled the silence, the guards had disappeared. 

“Haha, don’t worry I’m not someone suspiscous.” He said suspicously, holding his hands up. 

“Who are you?” 

“I just want to talk with a lady poking at frogs for fun.”

“That sounds stupid.”

“It does, doesn’t it?” He scratched the back of his neck with a shy expression.

TKprincename took his daily stroll when he chanced upon a light-blue clad girl crouching in the park. Her dress contrasted with the dull greens and dull browns making her pop out of the background. A little cloud, that was what he was reminded of.

Approching the girl he had been a little astonished as she had been so focused on poking the little poor creatures that she didn’t even notice him coming closer.

He had been a little astonished upon witnessing this little cloud poking the little poor creatures with a focused expression. She didn’t even notice him approaching behind her. 

She gave a perfect curtsy, one that only noble children could learn. Riffling through his memories, no noble child appeared to fit her description nor her name, Esther. Blue eyes, a shade deeper than her dress and golden hair shining in the sun. He had met them all, and remembered them all. It was impossible for him to forget.

She was currently glaring at him, probably because he stopped her guards from approaching. Nothing good would come from being witnessed here after all. 

“Do you want to something fun?”

“Fun?” She tilted her head to the side, making her hair flow gently. “Are you going to abduct me?”

“Pfft\! What?” Was she serious? 

“Either say yes or no.”

“Hmm… no?”

The girl stared at him for a moment, especillally at his lips. Was there something there? Rubbing his lips nothing appeared on his fingers. 

“I have to go ask my mom first then.”

TKprincename followed after the girl. She was rubbing her gloves, trying to get the stick-stains off from them. 

“Give me your hand?” 

“Why?”

“So I can hold it.”

“…” Surprisingly she extended her hand.

Holding onto her small hand, TKprincename focused on the air around him, collecting the small fragments of the freely floating mana into a ball. Having deemed it to be enough, he shot it towards her glove. In a second, the stain dissapered in the wind like smoke.

“You can use magic?” She raised one of her eyebrows.

“Sure can. Are you impressed?”

“What other things can you do?”

He told her all the little tricks he knew, just like the cleaning spell he just cast. Bubbles appeared and dissapeared. TK more spell thingies.

The girl looked to be more excited the more things he showed her. It was cute.

“Mom\! I found a mage\!” Bouncing to her sleeping mother, she looked just like any other girl.

“Oh, did you get another friend?” They looked alike was his first thought. 

“Are you going to attend the royal academy?” He asked.

TK scene where one of the guards and maybe aid tells him to stop running off. “Find everything about that girl” And if she will attend the royal academy

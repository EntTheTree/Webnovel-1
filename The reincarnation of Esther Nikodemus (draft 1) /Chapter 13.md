# Chapter 13

“This is your room Miss, do you have any questions?”

The room was as large as our house in Barre. It had a big bed, a big closet and a big vanity desk. Reflected on the mirror of the vanity desk was me. Long blond hair and puffy blue eyes. I had gotten used to seeing this face whenever something shiny reflected it, however today it looked completely bizarre.

Outside the big window situated on the third floor was the garden. A green color had begun taking over the place and I saw some flowers looking up at me from the square and circle bushes. I closed the curtains.

“Everything in here is mine?”

“That’s right.”

“How did that happen?” There wasn’t a speck of dust on my finger.

“His Grace wanted Miss’ and Miss’ family to have a comfortable stay.”

“I see.” The air was cold in this huge room.

“Can you remove these flowers for me?”

The maid that had been assigned to guide me paused for a second, she looked to be in her twenties.

“Of course Miss.” The flowers on the circular table in the middle got swiftly removed, vase and all.

“Thank you, that’ll be all.” She excused herself and left me alone in the huge room.

Sunlight tried to pry itself through the windows. Drawing all the curtains made it dim. At least the bed felt comfortable enough, my body sank downwards making the soft duvet squish me. My parents had a room on the left wing of the Estate while mine were on the right. I wonder how my mom is doing. Maybe I could try to cheer her up. I willed my body to move, but it was futile. My body didn’t move an inch, it merely stayed still.

Spread in front of me were several knives, forks and spoons. They glistened as the embroidery caught the light from the chandelier. The maids and servants began laying out the food. At the head of the table sat my grandfather, Duke Nikodemus. To his right sat my dad and mom, with the former sitting closer. I sat opposite of mom, making the seat between His Grace and I empty.

I copied what my mom was doing, start on the outside then work yourself inward. Holding the fork on my left and knife on my right, I cut into the thick piece of meat on my plate. It was tough. There was no problem with the cutting, but my left hand couldn’t anchor the steak properly, letting it slide with the motion of my knife. Feeling frustrated, I was about to give up when my plate disappeared and a new one replaced it. My father had given me his already cut plate of steak.

“Tsk, she doesn’t even know how to use a fork and knife. What have you been teaching her?”

“We have been teaching her the important things in life.”

“And knowing how to eat like a civilized person is not important?”

My father put down the utensils. “That’s enough.”

“Hah\! Keep spoiling her like that and regret is all you will get.”

“And what’s up with that glove of hers.” Mom looked at me with a sad expression.

Dessert was served after we finished the main dish. I’ve never seen so many different types of sweets before. There were cakes, cookies and even some wobbling thing. It tasted sweet and cold. I ate another one.

“Look at her stuffing her face, I ought to give her a tutor.”

After dinner, I went around to explore the estate. It almost seemed like a museum with all the paintings hanging on the walls. There was a particular one that rooted me on the spot. It depicted a grotesque figure taking a bite out of a person. Instead of looking satisfied, the face painted on the figure was a look of horror and disgust. Its eyes were staring at me.

“An interesting painting isn’t it?” The sudden question made my shoulders give a quick jump. It was the Duke speaking beside me.

“A personal friend of mine painted this.”

“Are there other paintings here made by them?” I wanted to see more.

“No, this is the only one he left with me.”

I looked at him. He was neatly dressed in a suit standing with a straight posture. It was hard to read his face as he stared at the painting, neither smiling nor frowning. His eyes were a little sunken, making him look a bit tired. Oh, I forgot to greet him. The peculiar atmosphere surrounding us made me hold my silence, the timing was long gone. Well, no matter. He can’t expect me to know perfect etiquette.

The painting looked similar to the paintings the temple liked to hang up. I had always wondered why they did that, hanging up paintings of demons. An answer had reared itself in my mind. It was a mirror, a painting of yourself.

“Why do you think I had this painting hung up in the main hallway?”

“As a reminder, Your Grace”

He paused. “Interesting. I haven’t heard that answer before.”

“Make time for tomorrow, your clothes look too shabby.”

I stood in front of a mirror double my size. Did it really have to be that big? It made me look much shorter than I really was. I saw my mom stand behind me, she was a head taller. I better make sure to eat more nutritious things.

A seamstress flitted around me, taking my dimensions as she made me spin around while lifting my arms up and down. She looked happy discussing what dresses fit me with her assistant.

“Golden hair and azure eyes, I think this design fits the best.” She held a design for a dress in her hand. TKdressDescription the skirt bloomed outwards stopping a bit below the knees. It was intended for young ladies like me. It looked pretty.

“Or wait\! What about this one?” She held another design. TKanotherdressDescription, this one stopped at the ankles. It also looked pretty.

“Assistant\! What should we do? Everything fits the young miss\!” They discussed noisily as I posed for them.

“Which one do you like, sweetie?” The duke had also ordered my mom to pick a few and make herself look presentable. She looked in her element as she wore that TKdress.

“I think this one would look cute on you\!” She picked the one with the knee-length skirt and ribbons.

“Ah\! Lady Victoria\!” The seamstress yelled.

“W-what is it?”

“That's right\! How could we forget\! Assistant, pick out all the cutest ones\!”

My new dress bounced up and down whenever I kicked my legs, creating soft ripples across the fabric. The seamstress also gave me a new pair of gloves which fit snugly like a glove, or like the stockings I currently wore. A plate of cookies was served to me as I sat with my mom in the gazebo in the garden. She was taking a nap with a cookie in her hands.

Sound of clashing and roars shook the otherwise calm afternoon. Investigating what was happening, I found myself looking on at dozens of knights training with their shirts off. The glistening sweat dripping down their muscles flew off each time they swung their swords. A commander was yelling orders at them.

Surrounding the training area in the middle were several raised tribunes, which made it look like an arena. I wonder why they need so many seats.

“Look over there man, there’s some kid watching us.”

“Kid? There’s no kid in the estate, just focus on your breathing.”

“Over there, she’s just sitting there.”

The young man sitting on the ground pointed at me. The other person went up to me and with the raised seats, made him have to look up at me. It felt weird not having to crane my neck talking to someone.

“Miss? What are you doing here?” His green hair reminded me of Finn.

“She’s obviously here to cheer us on\! Isn’t that right?” The other one had brown-orange hair and freckles.

“How heavy is that?” I pointed to the sword on his hip.

“Do you want to try to hold it?”

“Hey, what are you saying to her?”

“Here grab the hilt, be careful not to fall over the wall.”

It was surprisingly light. His comment about falling over the wall had made me expect something heavy, but the tip of the sword pointed towards the sky with a single hand. I gave it a few swings creating a swooshing sound.

“Hmm, surprisingly good form.” Green hair said.

“Now try to do this\!” Freckles showed me a move with his hands. It this it? The sword cut through the air.

“Haha\! You got talent for this little miss\!”

“What are you two fools fooling around here for?” A man went up to them.

“Commander look at her form when swinging\!”

“What nonsense, why should I—” I did the same move.

“Hmm… not bad.” The man rubbed his moustache. It twirled above his mouth in two neat circles.

“But I’m wondering about something. Who gave this young lady a sword\!” The commander gave the young men a kick to their behind. “Go back to your post\!”

The two of them, staggered back to their spot while rubbing where they had been kicked.

“My apologies for showing you such a sight, they are good but still young.”

“Why are you being so formal to me?”

“You’re miss Esther are you not? It’s hard to find someone with such brilliant hair. Your father and I used to be brother’s in arms.”

“Really?”

“He hasn’t told you?” He looked a bit sad.

“My father doesn’t talk much about his past.”

The commander rubbed his moustache again. “I see, considering what happened… nevermind. What are you doing over here?”

“It was interesting. And loud.”

“Loudness is the primary source of our energy after all.”

TK continue scene

I was still observing their training when a servant called for me. The duke was calling me to his office. Sitting around the tea table was both of my parents. The steam coming from their cups had already vanished.

“Do you know why you were called?”

“I do not, Your Grace.”

“I have decided to send a tutor for you. Go learn how to act like a noble tomorow.”

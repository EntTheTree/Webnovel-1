# Chapter 13

“This is your room Miss, do you have any questions?”

The room was as large as our house in Barre. It had a big bed, a big closet and a big vanity desk. Reflected on the mirror of the vanity desk was me. Long blond hair and puffy blue eyes. I had gotten used to seeing this face whenever something shiny reflected it, however today it looked completely bizarre. 

Outside the big window situated on the third floor was the garden. A green color had begun taking over the place and I saw some flowers looking up at me from the square and circle bushes. I closed the curtains.

“Everything in here is mine?” 

“That’s right.”

“How did that happen?” There wasn’t a speck of dust on my finger.

“His Grace wanted Miss’ and Miss’ family to have a comfortable stay.”

“I see.” The air was cold in this huge room.

“Can you remove these flowers for me?”

The maid that had been assigned to guide me paused for a second, she looked to be in her twenties. 

“Of course Miss.” The flowers on the circular table in the middle got swiftly removed, vase and all.

“Thank you, that’ll be all.” She excused herself and left me alone in the huge room.

Sunlight tried to pry itself through the windows. Drawing all the curtains made it dim. At least the bed felt comfortable enough, my body sank downwards making the soft duvet squish me. My parents had a room on the left wing of the Estate while mine were on the right. I wonder how my mom is doing. Maybe I could try to cheer her up. I willed my body to move, but it was futile. My body didn’t move an inch, it merely stayed still.

Spread in front of me were several knives, forks and spoons. They glistened as the embroidery caught the light from the chandelier. The maids and servants began laying out the food. At the head of the table sat my grandfather, Duke Nikodemus. To his right sat my dad and mom, with the former sitting closer. I sat opposite of mom, making the seat between His Grace and I empty.

Noble etiquette for dining was surprisingly simple. You start with the utensils on the outside and work yourself in, make sure to not make too much noise. I picked up the next pair of utensils and began cutting the venison steak. The food was unfortunately really delicious.  

“She eats like she has never eaten before. Are you even feeding her?”

“She eats plenty, we’re just tired from the trip.”

His Grace gave out a “hmph” and called for a servant standing at attention. 

“Give this to her.” It was another plate of venison. 

“You don’t have to eat it, Esther.” Dad said.

“Thank you, Your Grace.” I bowed my head. 

“I wonder who she takes after.” A shrilling sound could be heard coming from my father's plate. 

“And what’s up with that glove of hers.” My father put down his knife and fork. Mom just looked at me with a sad expression.

\*\*\*  
My first impression of my grandfather left me a little conflicted. I wanted to explore the estate after waking up from my nap. Strolling around and looking at the paintings was pretty fun. There was a particular painting that caught my attention. It depicted a grotesque figure lifting a person and eating them. Instead of a face of pleasure being painted on the figure, a look of horror and disgust stared back at me instead. 

“An interesting painting isn’t it?” The sudden question made my shoulders give a quick jump. It was the Duke speaking beside me.

“A personal friend of mine painted this.”

“Are there other paintings here made by them?” I wanted to see more.

“No, this is the only one he left with me.”

I looked at him. He was neatly dressed in a suit standing with a straight posture. It was hard to read his face as he stared at the painting, neither smiling nor frowning. His TKsamecolorasgales eyes were calm like the mountains I saw on the way here. The combined features really made one feel intimidated in his presence.

The timing to give my introduction or greet him had already passed. A peculiar atmosphere surrounded us as I held my silence, he must already know who I am.   
I thought no more of it and continued admiring the painting. The way the figure looked evoked an emotion from me. I finally figured out why the temple had the paintings of the demons hung up. It was a painting of yourself.

“Why do you think I had this painting hung up in the main hallway?”

“As a reminder, Your Grace”. He paused.

“I haven’t heard that answer before.”

He pulled something out of his pocket and gave it to me. It was my reward for entertaining him. Unwrapping the paper revealed a piece of candy. He left before I could say anything. It tasted like lemon, bittersweet.

\*\*\*  
The servants began taking our plates away, serving us after dinner tea. I’ve never had so much sugar in one day before. After the main dish, venison, was served, the desserts began rolling out. It was my favorite part of this meal. My stomach was filled to the brim. Mom looked happily at me seeing me wipe each and every plate given to me, she herself had only eaten about half of each, even the desserts.

“Where are my brother and sister?” 

“They are out managing their own territories.”

“I already sent out a letter telling them to come.” I sipped the hot tea.

“Were going to visit your mother tomorrow, so go buy yourselves some proper clothing.”

My grandmother wasn’t staying at the family Estate but at one of the church-TKsomethingwithrecuperating. It was one of the most advanced facilities in the empire employing only the best priests and healing mages. The only problem being that she felt lonely as the priests needed to precisely control all variables. There was no point in doing so anymore. 

A seamstress took my dimensions as I spun around and lifted my arms up and down. She flitted happily around and discussed my dresses with her assistant. 

“Golden hair and azure eyes, I think this design fits the best.” She held a design for a dress in her hand. TKdressDescription the skirt bloomed outwards stopping a bit below the knees. It was intended for young ladies like me. It looked pretty.

“Or wait\! What about this one?” She held another design. TKanotherdressDescription, this one stopped at the ankles. It also looked pretty.

“Assistant\! What should we do? Everything fits the young miss\!” They discussed noisily as I posed for them.

“Which one do you like, sweetie?” My mom had already chosen a pair of designs, she said she picked the ones she used to wear. Maybe I could pick something similar to hers.

“I think this one would look cute on you\!” She picked the one with the knee-length skirt and ribbons. 

“Ah\! Lady Victoria\!” The seamstress yelled.

“W-what is it?”

“That's right\! How could we forget\! Assistant, pick out all the cutest ones\!”

\*\*\*  
My new dress bounced up and down whenever the carriage rattled on the road. This one was ten times better than the other carriages as it had some kind of suspension system. It was fancy too, even bearing the Nikodemus family crest.

I kicked my legs back and forth watching the dress ripple softly. The seamstress also gave me a pair of new gloves which fit snugly like a glove, or a like the stockings I wore. My mom sat beside my dad who had his arms crossed. I sat with His Grace, who also had his arms crossed. Once again, our carriage ride rolled to its destination, only the sound of the slightly less rattling wheels could be heard.

We arrived at the facility that looked like a big church. The brick walls stood menacingly and with the combined height of the spiked roofs, made it towering above us. The main tower seemed to want to pierce the sky.

“Thank you for greeting us with your presence, Your Grace.” A priest had welcomed us into the facility. 

“It’s no problem, keep up the important work.”

“Her Grace is currently resting in the courtyard, please allow me to guide you.”

The facility looked exactly like a church, the only difference being there was no altar or a statue of the goddess. I felt my mouth smile.

The courtyard was even bigger than the one at the estate, it looked like a small forest, where all the trees and plants had been personally cultivated by numerous talented gardeners. I spotted an elderly looking woman sitting on a bench basking in the sunlight with a blanket over her legs.

My grandfather said something first upon spotting his wife. “Rosalyn.” He smiled gently as he called out to his wife.

“Oh, is that you, Gregor?” She held her husband's hand.

“What brings you here?” Her eyes looked at his voice with gray dreamlike eyes.

“I took that brat with me.” 

“Galen is here?” She opened her eyes wider.

“Hello mother, I’ve come to visit.”

“Oh my goddess\! Galen, it’s really you\!” My father had let her feel his face. 

“It has been so long…” I had to squint upon seeing her smile. 

“Welcome back, my son”. She patted my father’s hand as she smiled brightly. 

“Did you bring Victoria with you?”

“I’m here, Your Grace.”

“My, how thin your hands have gotten, are you eating properly?”

“Of course, these days have been a bit hectic is all.”

“You should take better care of yourself, you're still young.”

“I could say the same about Your Grace.” Mom’s smile looked like grandmother’s.  
   
“All these years and you still try to flatter me.” They gave out a chuckle together.

“How old is your daughter now?”

“You could ask her yourself”, she said cheeringly.

“You mean?”

My mom pulled me forward. “Hello, my name is Esther, I’m fourteen. Your Grace.” I had wanted to call her grandmother. 

“What a sweet voice, can you come closer?” I stared at her black hair. 

“You won’t mind this old wrinkly woman feel your face will you?” I stared at her crow’s feet.

“My\! You look just like Victoria\!” I stared at the mole under her eye. 

“Hello, Esther. My name is Rosalyn Nikodemus.” I stared at her dimples.

“But I would prefer it if you would call me grandmother.” I had seen her before. 

She looked happier here but it was still her. I thought it was a coincidence that Karrie had looked like Ann from my previous life. Now I finally understood. Just like with Ann. People I had killed popped up in this world, it made no sense otherwise.

I had killed this woman.

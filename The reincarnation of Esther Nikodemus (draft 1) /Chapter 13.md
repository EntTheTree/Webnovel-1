# Chapter 13

“This is your room Miss, do you have any questions?”

The room was as large as our house in Barre. It had a big bed, a big closet and a big vanity desk. Reflected on the mirror of the vanity desk was me. Long blond hair and puffy blue eyes. I had gotten used to seeing this face whenever something shiny reflected it, however today it looked completely bizarre. 

Outside the big window situated on the third floor was the garden. A green color had begun taking over the place and I saw some flowers looking up at me from the square and circle bushes. I closed the curtains.

“Everything in here is mine?” 

“That’s right.”

“How did that happen?” There wasn’t a speck of dust on my finger.

“His Grace wanted Miss’ and Miss’ family to have a comfortable stay.”

“I see.” The air was cold in this huge room.

“Can you remove these flowers for me?”

The maid that had been assigned to guide me paused for a second, she looked to be in her twenties. 

“Of course Miss.” The flowers on the circular table in the middle got swiftly removed, vase and all.

“Thank you, that’ll be all.” She excused herself and left me alone in the huge room.

Sunlight tried to pry itself through the windows. Drawing all the curtains made it dim. At least the bed felt comfortable enough, my body sank downwards making the soft duvet squish me. My parents had a room on the left wing of the Estate while mine were on the right. I wonder how my mom is doing. Maybe I could try to cheer her up. I willed my body to move, but it was futile. My body didn’t move an inch, it merely stayed still.

Spread in front of me were several knives, forks and spoons. They glistened as the embroidery caught the light from the chandelier. The maids and servants began laying out the food. At the head of the table sat my grandfather, Duke Nikodemus. To his right sat my dad and mom, with the former sitting closer. I sat opposite of mom, making the seat between His Grace and I empty.

I copied what my mom was doing, start on the outside then work yourself inward. Holding the fork on my left and knife on my right, I cut into the thick piece of meat on my plate. It was tough. There was no problem with the cutting, but my left hand couldn’t anchor the steak properly, letting it slide with the motion of my knife. Feeling frustrated, I was about to give up when my plate disappeared and a new one replaced it. My father had given me his already cut plate of steak. 

“Tsk, she doesn’t even know how to use a fork and knife. What have you been teaching her?”

“We have been teaching her the important things in life.”

“And knowing how to eat like a civilized person is not important?”

My father put down the utensils. “That’s enough.”

“Hah\! Keep spoiling her like that and regret is all you will get.”

“And what’s up with that glove of hers.” Mom looked at me with a sad expression.

Dessert was served after we finished the main dish. I’ve never seen so many different types of sweets before. There were cakes, cookies and even some wobbling thing. It tasted sweet and cold. I ate another one. 

“Look at her stuffing her face, I ought to give her a tutor.”

After dinner, I went around to explore the estate. It almost seemed like a museum with all the paintings hanging on the walls. There was a particular one that rooted me on the spot. It depicted a grotesque figure taking a bite out of a person. Instead of looking satisfied, the face painted on the figure was a look of horror and disgust. Its eyes were staring at me.

“An interesting painting isn’t it?” The sudden question made my shoulders give a quick jump. It was the Duke speaking beside me.

“A personal friend of mine painted this.”

“Are there other paintings here made by them?” I wanted to see more.

“No, this is the only one he left with me.”

I looked at him. He was neatly dressed in a suit standing with a straight posture. It was hard to read his face as he stared at the painting, neither smiling nor frowning. His dark eyes were calm like the mountains I saw on the way here. The combined features really made one feel intimidated in his presence.

I looked at him. He was neatly dressed in a suit standing with a straight posture. It was hard to read his face as he stared at the painting, neither smiling nor frowning. His eyes were a little sunken, making him look a bit tired. Oh, I forgot to greet him. The peculiar atmosphere surrounding us made me hold my silence, the timing was long gone. Well, no matter. He can’t expect me to know perfect etiquette. 

The painting looked similar to something that was at the back of my mind. It’s raw face, I had seen it somewhere. 

The painting looked similar to the paintings the temple liked to hang up. I had always wondered why they did that, hanging up paintings of demons. An answer had reared itself in my mind. It was a mirror, a painting of yourself.

“Why do you think I had this painting hung up in the main hallway?”

“As a reminder, Your Grace” 

He paused. “Interesting. I haven’t heard that answer before.”

“Make time for tomorrow, your clothes look too shabby.”

I stood in front of a mirror double my size. Did it really have to be that big? It made me look much shorter than I really was. I saw my mom stand behind me, she was a head taller. I better make sure to eat more nutritious things. 

A seamstress flitted around me, taking my dimensions as she made me spin around while lifting my arms up and down. She looked happy discussing what dresses fit me with her assistant.

“Golden hair and azure eyes, I think this design fits the best.” She held a design for a dress in her hand. TKdressDescription the skirt bloomed outwards stopping a bit below the knees. It was intended for young ladies like me. It looked pretty.

“Or wait\! What about this one?” She held another design. TKanotherdressDescription, this one stopped at the ankles. It also looked pretty.

“Assistant\! What should we do? Everything fits the young miss\!” They discussed noisily as I posed for them.

“Which one do you like, sweetie?” My mom had already chosen a pair of designs, she said she picked the ones she used to wear. Maybe I could pick something similar to hers.

“Which one do you like, sweetie?” The duke had also ordered my mom to pick a few and make herself look presentable. She looked in her element as she wore that TKdress. 

“I think this one would look cute on you\!” She picked the one with the knee-length skirt and ribbons. 

“Ah\! Lady Victoria\!” The seamstress yelled.

“W-what is it?”

“That's right\! How could we forget\! Assistant, pick out all the cutest ones\!”

My new dress bounced up and down whenever the carriage rattled on the road. This one was ten times better than the other carriages as it had some kind of suspension system. It was fancy too, even bearing the Nikodemus family crest.

I kicked my legs back and forth watching the dress ripple softly. The seamstress also gave me a pair of new gloves which fit snugly like a glove, or a like the stockings I wore. My mom sat beside my dad who had his arms crossed. I sat with His Grace, who also had his arms crossed. Once again, our carriage ride rolled to its destination, only the sound of the slightly less rattling wheels could be heard.

Today was Sunday, which meant visiting the church. I didn’t like the church. Back in Barre, whenever we visited, I always felt the priests staring at me. Whether they were curious about my body didn’t matter to me. Their stares were irritating. At least Karrie and Eric were there to chat with, how would I pass my time now?

The church in Barre was big. This one was enormous. The brick walls stood like towers watching over us. Combine that with the height of the spiked roofs made it look like the goal had to pierce the heavens. A big belltower rang, signaling the start of today’s service.

TK mass, maybe hear another buddhism teaching thingy

A priest greeted us after the mass. “Thank you for greeting us with your presence today, Your Grace.”

“It’s nothing, I should be the one thanking you for spreading the word of the Goddess.” The Duke shook his hand.

“Its a wonder that a man such as you is a devout believer, it really fills the heart of this old man.”

“If you are old, then what does that make me?” They looked like how my father laughed with Karrie’s father.

“Who did you bring with you today? Did you have a child hidden somewhere?”

“...”

“Remarkable…”

The duke then introduced us, saying that due to personal reasons, he called his son back. 

“You must be Esther then, would you mind if I tried to use some of my divine magic on you?” 

“Yes, I would mind. I’d rather you didn’t” 

“Esther\! Why are you being so rude?” My mom asked. 

Divine magic wouldn’t work on me anyway, why should I let them do whatever they wanted? I wasn’t some test subject for their enjoyment. Look, he has that curious look on his face too. They are all the same aren’t they. 

“Oh, it’s alright, curiosity got the better of me. I hope you can forgive me for stepping over the line.” His eyes narrowed. 

“It’s fine, I know you didn’t mean anything by it.” 

“Haha, such an understanding child, I can already see the bright future ahead of you\!”

“My name is TKpriestname, should there be something that bothers you, feel free to visit our church again.”

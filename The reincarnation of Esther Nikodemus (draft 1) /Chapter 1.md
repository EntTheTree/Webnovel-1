# Chapter 1

Standing there in front of the statue, I couldn’t help but think about my short but long life. The thought irritated me as the smell of incense wafted in the air. It did nothing but fuel my frustration further as I stared at the gold-plated statue of a buddha smiling smugly at me. Its expression seemed to be mocking me, a perfect symmetrical sneer crafted by some master artist. A human making something divine, laughable.

Blood from a hole in my abdomen had trickled down my legs staining the wooden floorboards. The sirens were still blaring and occasional shouts could be heard from the officers surrounding the lonesome temple. Red and blue lights invaded through the windows, banishing the shadows in this dimly lit room. 

“You are surrounded\! Come out with your hands up\!”. 

A familiar voice echoed through the night by the way of a megaphone. It was the detective that has been chasing me for the past weeks. I had a nagging feeling of being watched and got my suspicions confirmed when he showed up at the temple I stayed at. Grinning as he asked me a bunch of questions. I couldn’t help but stare at his peculiar scar over his left eye.

In this bustling concrete jungle of a city, stood the temple on top of a hill surrounded by nature. Having nowhere else to go, I eventually found myself walking to this place. A monk sweeping the grounds had greeted me, introducing himself and the history of the temple. I couldn’t do naught but stand there and listen to the whole history lesson from the increasingly cheerful monk. I guess even monks get lonely from time to time. 

Having learnt the whole in and outs of the temple, I got invited to have a meal as a reward for listening so attentively, something my rumbling stomach accepted for me, eliciting a chuckle from the monk. Stuffing my face with food for the first time in a while, my tired state hit me like a truck. The monk watching me, offered a room I could use as it had gotten late. The room was for monks-in-training but none had shed their modern life in recent years. 

The sounds of footsteps coming closer and closer were like a noose tightening around my neck, depriving me of oxygen. No wait, I was just lightheaded from all the bloodloss. 

Glancing at my blood-stained knife in my hand, I debated which way to die was less painful. Stabbing myself in the neck or getting shot by those officers outside. 

The monks at the temple were a little surprised that a new face had popped up overnight, thinking that I must have been a new trainee. With all the information I got from chatting with them, I could have really been a real monk-in-training but something fundamental stopped me from becoming one. The five precepts. 

If I’m going to die anyway, prison was not an option, maybe I could spare one of them from committing the act of taking a life. But wouldn’t stabbing myself also be an act of killing? I should’ve asked when I had the chance. 

Having lost strength in my legs, I opted to lay there, in the middle of the room. This was my first time in this room. It was as if something invisible had blocked my consciousness from entering the main room. Maybe the sight of the towering statue acted as some talisman, forbidding a murderer like me from entering. 

“Death is not the end and life is not the start, all of us will be affected by the wheel of reincarnation”, the monk had said. Maybe I will be a cat or something in my next life. That would be fun, I thought to myself as my consciousness flickered in and out. In the end, I couldn’t chose to kill myself.

“Detective, is this really her? The killer making waves in the headlines lately?”

The officer couldn’t help but ask, seeing the still body of the girl. He had a daughter about her age and all she did was chat with her friends and stay up late.

“Don’t let her appearance fool you, we have four confirmed murders and three unconfirmed”

“Wow, how did a girl like her turn into this? She must have been possessed or something”, rubbing his arms, he glanced around.

“Just look where she chose to live. It gives me the creeps I tell you”

“Enough chatting, wrap it up and give me a report later. The media and higher ups have been on my ass ever since that incident”.

“He had a promotion lined up and all…”, the officer couldn’t help but lament, watching the back of the detective leaving and lighting up a cigarette.

“Good riddance”, draping a sheet of cloth over the girl, the officer began to write his report.

“Father\!”, the mother looked distraught, “My daughter, she will wake up won’t she? She must be just sleeping, right?”

Having looked over this girl from late morning to late night, I could only come to one conclusion. Her daughter won't ever open her eyes again. 

“I’m sorry… She doesn’t have long” It was never easy telling a parent about the fate of their child. The woman wailed as she held unto her dying daughter.

“You should begin the ritual”. The goddess had given us this magic spell to ensure a person’s soul would safely come back into the heavens. 

“No\!”, she cried. “I won’t do it\! She’s not dead\! Oh baby, open your eyes please\!”

She grabbed my garment, pleading. “You can use healing magic can't you? Just do that\!”

“I have already used up all my mana, it had no effect”. Even if healing magic couldn’t turn a terminal ill person into a healthy person, it should have had some effect. But the spells had failed, almost as if it bounced off her. That was why I was so sure she was nearing death.

“Oh my baby, please open your eyes. What am I supposed to do without you\!”

It seemed as if this child was struggling with an illness for a long time as scattered around the room were a plethora of plants and medicine, a pungent smell coming from them. From the explanation I got from her, I couldn’t imagine how it was to live with this unknown illness that all these medicines could not cure. Being bedridden from walking too far, getting a fever for feeling the wind, and failing to retain whatever she ate. What a pitiful life this child had.

Her appearance laying there seemed to be at least peaceful. She had inherited her blonde hair from her mother which laid well-combed to her sides. Her mother had combed it, doing whatever she could for her daughter. Her blue eyes glimmered brilliantly under the candle light as it stared at her mother. She looked just like a smaller version of her. Hmm? Staring?

“What am I to tell your father\!” Her tears dropped onto the girl's cheek.

“What…”

Flinching from the unexpected sound from, her crying stopped. 

How is this possible? My healing magic didn’t work and her heart had stopped?

“Oh my goddess\!” I could see her face full of joy. “My baby\!”

“A miracle… This must be a miracle…” I must document this. I must show the other priests.

As I rummaged through my bags to find something to write on, and while the mother hugged her child shedding tears of joy, the words from the little girl stopped us both in our tracks.

“Who are you?”, a hoarse voice called out.

—

The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was a beautiful crying woman. Is this heaven? That can’t be. I can’t be in heaven. The woman seemed to be shocked about something. Her expression mirrored the expression of the man next to her. He wore some really gaudy white clothes reminiscent of the priests that had visited the temple. 

Didn’t I die? I tried to ask them but my voice failed to make a sound. Glancing downwards the view shocked me. This wasn’t my body. As I thought of moving my hand, a small childlike hand moved accordingly instead. An unnatural gold-colored hair flowed by the sides of my view and my chest had gotten a bit smaller… 

This must be a dream, but the aches in my body soon banished that thought. Everything hurt as I laid there in the bed. The pain was even worse than being shot.

Using all the strength I could muster, I focused my attention on the woman. “Who are you?” Even my voice was different. 

I stared absentmindedly at the bowl of porridge in my hands. The warmth from it seeped through my hands, heating up my body a little. Its grayish color didn’t really whet my appetite but as the flying spoon flew toward my mouth I had to accept it nonetheless. 

*One shouldn’t judge a book by its cover,* I remembered hearing someone say. A subtle sweetness enveloped my tongue as the porridge spread through my mouth and down my throat, warming it up.

She looked at me with crescent moon shaped eyes. “How is it?” 

“It’s good” My childlike voice rang out. “What is it?” 

“I’m glad”, she said with a big smile, “it’s oat porridge, I used to make it whenever you would get sick”. I accepted another spoonful from her.

This woman was supposedly my mother. A pretty woman with golden hair the same as mine and brilliant blue eyes reminiscent of a cloudless blue sky. Her youthful stature would make one wonder if she really was a mother, her age doesn’t show at all.

According to this woman, Victoria, my name was Esther, 13 years old. I had been struggling with illnesses my whole life but it was especially bad this time, even putting me on the edge of death. The priest had said that it was a miracle as someone not accepting healing magic was a sure sign of death. Although he had no answers as to why I didn’t have any memories.

Healing magic. Magic. I don’t really know what to expect anymore. But I knew for a fact by instinct that the one that was supposed to be in this body, Esther, was dead. I didn’t feel the need to tell him that. Victoria looked gleefully at the now empty bowl of porridge. 

A day had passed since I’ve taken over Esther’s body. My body still ached all over but speaking had become less of a strain, so I passed the time by asking a bunch of questions to Victoria.

This country was called the Guillain Empire and it was currently year 563 of the imperial calendar. We lived in some place being ruled by a count whose name I couldn’t remember. Yeah, this wasn’t earth.

“A planet? Is it some kind of plant?” She was sitting on a chair by my bedside. 

“It’s not a plant, I just remembered the word”

Her eyes got filled with hope. “Really? Do you remember anything else?”

“No, sorry…” 

“Oh, it’s nothing to be sorry about sweetie, lets just take it slow”

She put her hand onto my head and began patting me. It felt oddly comforting. 

“M-mom?” The word got stuck in my throat. “Can I ask another question?”

“Of course\!” She pumped her fists, cheering me on.

“Do I have a dad?”  
“Oh…”, she looked a bit wistful.

“He’s on a monster expedition”

“Monsters? They sound dangerous”

“Don’t you worry a bit my little pumpkin, your father is stronger than he looks\! Why do you think I married him?”. She began singing her praises. I could tell from the way she spoke about her husband that they were a happy couple.

I searched my memories for some involving my father but quickly stopped. It was a stupid idea. 

“Do you think he will be glad to see me?”

“Why do you say that?” Her concerned face came a bit closer as she held my hands.

“I don’t remember him at all.” Clenching my hands in her own, she pulled me into a hug. 

“It doesn’t matter my baby, we would still love you all the same. There is always time for new memories, and who knows? Maybe your memories will come back tomorrow?”

I could feel the warmth in her words as she hugged me, warming up my own body. A twinge of guilt took its place in my heart, where her body warmth had seeped into. I didn’t want to let go of this warmth.

# Chapter 12

Countless people streamed across the narrow sidewalks as the sun peeked between the tall buildings, casting a cool shadow across the double-wide road. The road was laid with cobblestones, making the carriages rattle as they passed each other by. I could feel my back being stroked as I forced myself to describe more things I saw out of the carriage.

My father sat on our side crossing his arms. “At least you had the forethought to send a carriage without a family crest.”

“Of course, I personally witnessed your temperament last time.” Raviel sat opposite of us, her back against the driver’s seat. The seats may be a little small for two adults and sitting together, yet this was the best configuration we decided.

Duke Nikodemus, my grandfather, had sent Raviel to pick us up at the magic gate station. Her hair had grown a bit longer, it now reached to her shoulders. She had exchanged her usual bow and pants for a simple but elegant dress. TKdressdescription. It flowed softly downwards only stopping once it reached her ankles. Hadn’t it been for the colors, I would have thought she wore one of those maid outfits.

No one said anything in the carriage, only sounds of the wooden wheels hitting the cobblestone entertained our whole way to our destination. We were going to finally meet the patriarch, Gregor Nikodemus. My mothers hand trembled as she continued to stroke my back. 

We crossed a large gate where a guard confirmed Raviel’s identity, giving her a little bow. Behind the gate stood a paved path sandwiched by two large swathes of bushes and trees. A gazebo could be seen on the right side.

The rows of bushes converged together letting the Estate stand centerpoint, it looked magnificent, several times bigger than our inn we had lodged at for two days. A friendly looking gentleman was waiting on the stairs for us with several other maids and servants lined up behind him. They went immediately to work upon our arrival, unloading our luggage.

My father opened the carriage door, letting the refreshing air in much to my delight, before stepping confidently out. My mother followed suit as she used my dads  outstretched hand as a balance point while stepping gracefully down. It was a little surprising how natural she looked being escorted by my dad. Then it was my turn. My father grabbed me by the sides and lifted me down with a childlike plop. Wow.

“Welcome back Young Master Galen.” The butler said, crow’s feet forming at the corners.

“I’m not that young anymore, Alden.” 

“I see you too are in good health, Lady Victoria”

“It has been a while, sir Alden.” She gave a pretty curtsy.

“You must be the young mistress.” 

I mirrored the curtsy my mom had done. “Hello, my name is Esther. I’m fourteen.”

“Goodness, has it really been that long?” He bent his knee making me look down at him slightly. “Welcome to the Nikodemus Estate”, his smile was bright. “Our most treasured possession.”

We were being led down a long carpeted hall by the butler, it felt weird walking on something so soft and squishy. My dad had wanted to meet with the Duke immediately 

“I see nothing has changed around here since I left”,

“Nothing has changed here since I left

“I see that nothing

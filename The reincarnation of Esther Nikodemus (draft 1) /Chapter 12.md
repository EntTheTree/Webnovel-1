# Chapter 12: The estate

Countless people streamed across the narrow sidewalks as the sun peeked between the tall buildings, casting a cool shadow across the double-wide road. The road was laid with cobblestones, making the carriages rattle as they passed each other by. I could feel my back being stroked as I forced myself to describe more things I saw out of the carriage.

My father sat on our side crossing his arms. “At least you had the forethought to send a carriage without a family crest.”

“Of course, I personally witnessed your temperament last time.” Raviel sat opposite of us, her back against the driver’s seat. The seats may be a little small for two adults and sitting together, yet this was the best configuration we decided.

Duke Nikodemus, my grandfather, had sent Raviel to pick us up at the magic gate station. Her hair had grown a bit longer, it now reached to her shoulders. She had exchanged her usual bow and pants for a simple but elegant dress. TKdressdescription. It flowed softly downwards only stopping once it reached her ankles. Hadn’t it been for the colors, I would have thought she wore one of those maid outfits.

No one said anything in the carriage, only sounds of the wooden wheels hitting the cobblestone entertained our whole way to our destination. We were going to finally meet the patriarch, Gregor Nikodemus. My mothers hand trembled as she continued to stroke my back. 

We crossed a large gate where a guard confirmed Raviel’s identity, giving her a little bow. Behind the gate stood a paved path sandwiched by two large swathes of bushes and trees. A gazebo could be seen on the right side.

The rows of bushes converged together letting the Estate stand centerpoint, it looked magnificent, several times bigger than our inn we had lodged at for two days. A friendly looking gentleman was waiting on the stairs for us with several other maids and servants lined up behind him. They went immediately to work upon our arrival, unloading our luggage.

My father opened the carriage door, letting the refreshing air in much to my delight, before stepping confidently out. My mother followed suit as she used my dads  outstretched hand as a balance point while stepping gracefully down. It was a little surprising how natural she looked being escorted by my dad. Then it was my turn. My father grabbed me by the sides and lifted me down with a childlike plop. Wow.

“Welcome back Young Master Galen.” The butler said, crow’s feet forming at the corners.

“I’m not that young anymore, Alden.” 

“I see you too are in good health, Lady Victoria”

“It has been a while, sir Alden.” She gave a pretty curtsy.

“You must be the young miss.” 

I mirrored the curtsy my mom had done. “Hello, my name is Esther. I’m fourteen.”

“Goodness, has it really been that long?” He bent his knee making me look down at him slightly. “Welcome to the Nikodemus Estate”, his smile was bright. “Our most treasured possession.”

We were being led down a long carpeted hall by the butler, it felt weird walking on something so soft and squishy. 

“It’s a shame that Master TKgale’sbrothername and Miss TKgale’ssister isnt here to keep you company.”

“Alden.” My father stopped walking. “I’m only here for one purpose, just take me to my father.”

“Of course my lord, my age must be showing. Here, this door.”

“Still using the same room I see.” My dad was about to open when the butler stopped him.

“I must ask that only you meet with His Grace.” 

“And why is that?” My father squinted at him.

“His Grace asked for your understanding.”

“That’s rich coming from him.”

My mom spoke up. “It sounds important, dear, you should listen to him. Sir Alden, can you find us a place to rest?”

“Of course my Lady, please follow me.”

I followed my mom as we left dad for himself. The door seemed to swallow him as he went inside. 

“Thank you for convincing him” The butler did a little bow as he opened the door to another room. 

“I didn’t do it for you.” The room looked to be a guestroom, it was huge. 

“I just want to get out here as fast as possible.” She closed the door behind her.   

\*\*\*  
Galen went into the room and saw his father sitting at the same couch he always sat on. A bunch of documents lay spread over the low-raised tea table. Hearing the door to his office open and close, he put down the document in his hand. 

“You are late.”

“Good to see you too, your grace”. Gale stood in front of the tea table hands behind his back. He looked down at his father, he had gotten older, gray hairs could be seen here and there. 

“Why did you call for me?”

“You were supposed to arrive last week.” Was it that important whether he was late or not? He hadn’t seen his son in years and the first thing he said upon meeting him was, “You are late”, seriously? Gale couldn’t help but lose his cool. 

“I will take my leave if you don’t tell-” 

“Your mother is dying.” 

The words coming from his father were unexpected, it didn’t even register in his head. 

“What?”

Sure, he didn’t ask about the whereabouts of his mother or how she was doing, but he chalked it up to being busy. She should still be healthy at her age. He had planned to introduce his beautiful daughter to her before leaving again.

“She doesn’t have many days left.” Galen could hear his father’s voice tremble a little.

“The priest had said a month.” It was the first time he saw his father’s figure look like this. His father, one of the most powerful men in the empire, one of the most strict fathers he knew of, and one who never showed much emotion, had a sad expression on his face. His father looked small, sitting there on his worn out couch.

“It must now be three weeks left since you are finally here.” But he couldn’t feel his anger rise inside of him. He wouldn’t have delayed the trip to the capital this much if he had known. He had wasted away a week of his mothers life. All because the stupid letter didn’t say why he was called back.

“Why didn’t you say that in the letter?” Galen practically growled.

“Take a seat, we have much to go through.” The aging man simply straightened out the documents on the table. They were thick with ink.

“I would have come as fast as I could if you had just written that\!”

Gregor slammed his fist on the table. “Take. A. Seat.”

“How am I to look at some damned piece of papers right now\! What even are these?\!” He picked up the nearest document on the table. “Is this her inheritance?\!” Galen’s voice got louder for each new sentence he said.

But the next words from his father trumped even that, booming in the room, even penetrating out into the hall and the neighboring rooms. 

“Yes they are\!\!” Gregor Nikodemus stood up. 

“Laying dying in her bed\! Wrote this piece of paper\! Giving all her everything to you\!”

He was screaming into the face of his son, his youngest son, his son that had forsaken his name. Galen couldn’t do naught but looked shocked at his father grabbing him by his collar. He looked down at the man that had raised him, he looked down. His father had gotten smaller in the time he was gone.

“To her most ungrateful\! And insane child\!”

\*\*\*  
It was delicious, I had to take another piece. A maid had come in with some tea and refreshments. A plate of cookies looking like small checkerboards sat in front of me. I had missed this sweet taste.

My mom was staring at me as I stuffed another one in my mouth. “Is it good?”

I couldn’t answer with my mouth full so I opted to nod instead.

“Maybe I should call for another plate.”

“Really?” My mom seemed to sparkle more than usual today.

“Of course\! Your mother used to live here a long time ago, you know?”

“Why did you leave?” It had been bothering me for a while.

“Oh…”, she seemed to find an answer. “How about we tell you when we get home again?”

“You don’t need to tell me if you don’t want to.”

“You’re not curious?”

“You and dad seem to get sad whenever you talk about it. I don’t need to know.”

She smiled. “My sweet and lovely daughter, I pray that you are always happy and healthy\!” She went up and gave me a hug. I could see some crumbs falling onto her dress as she nuzzled up against me.

A new plate of cookies had been delivered. The maid gave me a gentle smile as she bowed herself out of the room with the polished ceramic plate on her cart. It tasted a bit different, earthy with bits of sweetness. I observed the cookie in my hand, flat on the bottom and dome shaped. It looked rustic with the visible pieces of grain sticking out of it with black colored dots adding a bit of color. I didn’t like raisins but who knows when I would eat something sweet for free ever again? 

“Are we leaving after dad has finished talking?” I munched on the last cookie.

“If all goes well.” My mother was sipping her second cup of tea. The tea cup seemed different and hard to hold, ours at home looked more like mugs. She held it gracefully, letting her pinky point outwards.

“Will I be able to meet my grandfather?”

“You should call him His Grace when referring to him.” My mom taught me a lot of noble etiquette while traveling. It was interesting, but I sometimes forgot in the moment. 

“Although I don’t think your father wants you to meet with him.” 

“Does he hate His Grace?”

She put down her cup with a soft clink. “It’s hard to say.”

“What about Her Grace, can I meet her?”

“That should be doable, I actually want to meet her again too\!” Mom must really like my grandmother to smile like that.

“Let’s ask your father after he is done talking.”

It’s a shame that our rooms had a room in between us, making it impossible to hear what they were talking about. Must be to protect against eavesdroppers. I couldn’t help but click my tongue in my head.

The door opened and my dad took a step in. My mother quickly got up and held his face in her hands. He didn’t look well. I felt my stomach drop.

“Gale, what happened? What did you talk about?”

“Victoria…” He sounded hoarse.

“Yes I’m here.” He laid his head on her shoulder.

“My mother is dying…” The room was silent.

“She has three weeks left.”

“That can’t be…” My mother’s voice trembled. I felt my throat squeeze up.

“We have to stay here until…”

Why was this always happening?

“...until my mother passes away.”

“No…” My mom lost the strength in her legs. It was like a pull-string doll that used all of its rope. 

“I’m sorry.”

Why couldn’t we just have happy days, why must I always feel this way. In this life and my previous life. 

I watched as my father carried my crying mother to the couch. I couldn’t help but do the same as I stood there.

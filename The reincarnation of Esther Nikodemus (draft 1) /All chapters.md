# Chapter 1

Standing there in front of the statue, I couldn’t help but glare at it. It was a gold-plated statue of a buddha. A master craftsman had probably sculpted it, declaring it his life’s work, getting praised by all the monks visiting. But all I felt as it stood there, towering over me, was irritation. Its expression seemed to be mocking me. A perfectly symmetrical smug smile. 

I had been shot. Pressing down on the wound in my abdomen did little to stop the warm trail of blood sliding down my legs, staining the wooden floorboards in the process. The smell of incense invaded my nose, the same way the flashing red and blue lights invaded through the shuttered windows, painting away the darkness. 

The sirens were still blaring and occasional shouts could be heard surrounding this secluded temple. A familiar voice echoed through the night through the help of a megaphone.

“You are surrounded\! Come out with your hands up\!” 

It was the detective that has been chasing me for the past few weeks. 

I had a nagging feeling of being watched and got my suspicions confirmed when he showed up at the temple. He had asked me a bunch of questions but not once did he write down my answers. He just stared at me. I stared back, at his peculiar scar over his left eye.

In this bustling concrete jungle of a city, stood a lonesome temple on the outskirts of top of a hill. Instead of skyscrapers surrounding it, trees and plants did instead. Having nowhere else to go, I eventually found myself standing before this very place. A monk sweeping the grounds had greeted me, introduced himself and then broke out into a long winded lesson, regaling the history of the temple. 

Did I ask for this service? No. Did I ask him to stop? No, of course not. This happened more often than I would admit, someone finding me and blathering on and on about this or that. He looked increasingly more cheerful the more he talked, hitting all the bullet points. I must have been the only one that listened to his whole presentation.

Having learnt all the ins and outs of the temple, the monk invited me to have a meal as a reward. Having nothing but the shirt on my back, I accepted. Stuffing my face with food for the first time in a while, my body just wanted to lay down and sleep. Noticing this, the monk offered me a room to use, perhaps noticing my predicament. I, a young girl, had just wandered into a temple with nothing.

The room was intended for monks-in-training but no one had shed their modern life in recent years. The room had a mattress and that was it. It was bare. It was like looking into a mirror. I accepted the room.

The sounds of heavy footsteps came closer and closer and the silhouettes obstructed the windows. Glancing down at my blood-stained knife, I debated which way to die was less painful. Stabbing myself in the neck, or getting shot by those standing over there.

The monks at the temple were a little surprised when they saw that a new face had popped up overnight. They began chatting with me immediately, debating to each other about this or that while I stood there, watching. When I had opened my mouth and told them that I wasn’t a new monk in training, I expected them to be a little disappointed. They just smiled gently at me instead.

There were two things stopping me from becoming a real monk-in-training. One, I couldn’t follow the base five precepts. I had already committed one of them. The other reason had something to do with this room, the room with the big statue.

This was my first time in this room. I had tried to enter before but each time, as if some invisible barrier had formed, I couldn’t cross the boundary of the doorway. The golden statue acted like some talisman, protecting itself from me. But strangely enough, I had no problems entering today, my bloody footprints painting a path across the wide floor.

“Death is not the end, nor is life the start. We will all suffer while under the effect of the wheel of reincarnation.” A monk said to me one day. I didn’t really want to die but the thought of reincarnating again seemed to fill me with hope. Maybe I will be a cat in my next life? Laying about and sleeping whenever, or I could be a bird? Spreading out my wings and gliding through the open air. 

My consciousness flickered in and out as I laid there in front of the statue. In the end, I couldn’t choose how I died. I just bled out with the glowing statue smiling down at me.

\*\*\*

“Detective, is this really her? The one making waves in the headlines lately?”

The officer couldn’t help but ask after seeing the dead body of the girl. He had a daughter about her age. All she did was chat with her friends on the phone and staying up all night.  

“Don’t let her appearance fool you, we already have three confirmed bodies”

“Really? You really can’t judge a book by its cover. How did a girl like her turn into a ruthless killer?” The officer took a picture. “She must have been possessed or something, look at this place. The statues give me the creeps, I tell you” He rubbed his arms.

“Enough chatting, wrap it up and give me that report. The media and higher ups have been on my ass ever since that incident.”

“What a shame, he was about to retire and all…”

“He had a promotion lined up and all…” The detective left to light a smoke.

“Good riddance.” Draping a sheet of cloth over the girl, the officer began with his report.

\*\*\*  
My hands lit up as I injected the girl with my divine mana. It didn’t work.

“Father\!” The mother looked distraught, “My daughter, she will wake up won’t she? She must be just sleeping, right?”

Having looked over this girl from late morning to late night, I could only come to one conclusion. Her daughter won’t be able to open her eyes again.

“I’m sorry… it’s not working…” Divine magic was supposed to heal all except for a few cases. Cases where the patient was going to die no matter what. I had expended all of mana.

“She doesn't have long…” 

It was never easy telling a parent about the fate of their child. The woman wailed as she held unto her dying daughter.

“You should start the ritual”. The goddess had given us magic and rituals to help us live. The ritual would ensure a safe passage for a person’s soul on its destination to the pearly gates.

“No\!” She cried. “I won’t do it\! She’s not dead\! My baby, open your eyes please\!”

She grabbed my garment, pleading. “You can use healing magic can't you? Why isn’t it doing anything?\!”

I stayed silent.

Even if divine magic couldn’t turn a terminal ill person into a healthy person, it should still have had some effect. But each time I tried to inject her with mana, it simply bounced off. She must already be dead.

“Oh my baby, please open your eyes. What am I supposed to do without you\!”

The plethora of plants and medicines sprawled across the room, seemed to tell about the girl’s long struggle against her body. Hearing what the mother said, I couldn’t imagine how it must have been living with an unknown incurable disease. Being bedridden whenever she walked too far, getting life endangering fevers for no reason, and not being able to retain her food. What a pitiful life this child has lived.

At least she seemed to be at peace laying there on the bed. A sharp contrast to the haggard looking mother, despair evident on her face. Her golden blonde hair laid to her sides. Her mother had combed it, holding onto whatever hope she had for her daughter. Probably expecting her to wake up any moment now. Apart from her hair, she also inherited the color of her eyes. The pair of brilliantly blue eyes reflected the light from the magic-powered lamp and stared at her mother. They could almost be mistaken for being sisters. Hmm? Staring?

“What am I to tell your father\!” Her tears dropped onto the girl's cheek, leaving a trail as it plopped onto the pillow.

“What…”

Flinching from the unexpected sound, her tears stopped in their tracks. 

What? How is this possible?

“Oh my goddess\!” She let out a yell full of joy. “My baby\!”

“A miracle… This must be a miracle…” I have just witnessed a real miracle. I must document this.

I rummaged through my bags to find something to write on, and while the mother hugged her child shedding tears of joy, the words from the little girl stopped us both from moving.

“Who are you?” A hoarse voice called out.

\*\*\*

The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was a beautiful crying woman. An angel? That can’t be. I can’t be in heaven. The woman seemed to be shocked about something. Her expression mirrored the expression of the man next to her, who wore some really gaudy white clothes reminiscent of the priests that had visited the temple. 

Didn’t I die? Glancing downwards the view shocked me. This wasn’t my body. When I thought of moving my hand, a small childlike hand moved accordingly instead. An unnatural gold-colored hair flowed brightly down my face and my chest had gotten a bit smaller… 

This had to be a dream, but my body ached too much for me to really believe that. Everything hurt as I laid there in the bed. The pain was even worse than being shot.

With all the strength I could muster, I focused on the woman. “Who are you?” Wow, even my voice was different. 

I stared absentmindedly at the bowl of porridge in my hands. The warmth from it seeped through my hands, heating up my body a little. Its grayish color didn’t exactly whet my appetite but as the floating spoon flew toward my mouth I had to open it.

*One shouldn’t judge a book by its cover,* I remembered hearing someone say. A subtle sweetness enveloped my tongue as the porridge spread through my mouth and down my throat, warming it up.

The woman looked at me with crescent moon shaped eyes. “How is it?” 

I opened my mouth. “It’s good.” And a childlike voice rang out. “What is it?” 

“I’m glad”, she said with a big smile. “It’s oat porridge, I used to make it whenever you would get sick”. I accepted another spoonful from her.

This woman was supposedly my mother. A pretty person with golden hair, the same hue as mine, and blue eyes reminiscent of a cloudless blue sky. Her youthful appearance would make one wonder if she actually was a mother, her age didn’t show at all.

According to this woman, Victoria, my name was Esther, 13 years old. I had been struggling with illnesses my whole life but it was especially bad this time, even putting me on the edge of death. The priest had said that it was a miracle as a person rejecting healing magic was a sure sign of death. He had no answers as to why I didn’t have any memories, much to Victoria’s chagrin.

Healing magic. Magic. I didn’t really know what to expect anymore, however I knew for a fact by instinct, that the one that was supposed to be in this body, Esther, was dead. I didn’t feel the need to tell them that. Victoria looked gleefully at the now empty bowl of porridge. 

A day has passed since I’ve taken over Esther’s body. My body still hurts all over but speaking has become less of a strain, resulting in me passing the time by asking a bunch of questions to Victoria.

This country was called the Guillain Kingdom and it was currently year 563 of the common calendar. We lived in some town ruled by some baron whose name I couldn’t remember. This was totally different from the earth I knew.

“A planet? Is it some kind of plant?” She was sitting on a chair by my bedside. 

“It’s not a plant, I think. I just remembered the word.”

Her eyes were filled with hope. “Really? Do you remember anything else?”

“No, sorry…” 

“Oh, it’s nothing to be sorry about sweetie, lets just take it slow”

She put her hand onto my head and began patting me. It felt oddly comforting. 

“M-mom?” The word got stuck in my throat. “Can I ask another question?”

“Of course\!” She pumped her fists, cheering me on.

“Do I have a father?”

“Oh…” She looked like a wilted flower. It was kind of amazing how fast she flipped between her emotions.

“He is currently out hunting monsters.”

“Hunting monsters? That sounds dangerous.” I imagined monsters like big snakes and dragons and… I didn’t know any more monsters. 

“They can be…” She looked out the window. “But don’t you worry a bit my little pumpkin, your father is stronger than he looks\! Why do you think I married him?”  
She began singing his praises. I could tell from the way she spoke that they were happily married. I searched through my memories for something involving my father but quickly stopped. It was a stupid idea. 

“Do you think he will be glad to see me?”

“Why do you say that?” Her concerned face came a bit closer as she held my hands.

“I don’t remember him at all.” I felt my hands being squeezed and something warm wrapping around me. She had pulled me into a hug. 

“It doesn’t matter if you remember us or not, just know that we will love you all the same. There is always time for new memories, and who knows? Maybe your memories will come back after a good night’s sleep? You can see your father tomorrow too.”

I could feel the warmth in her words as she swaddled me. It warmed up my body, however a twinge of guilt took root in my heart, where her body warmth had managed to seep into. I didn’t want to let go of this warmth. 

# Chapter 2

I could hear the front door open downstairs as someone entered the house. My mother was talking to someone with a manly voice before a barrage of footsteps sprinted up the stairs.

“Esther\!” A man barged into the room. The first thing I noticed were his clothes. Leather armor outfitted with metal plates and clinking on his belt was a genuine sword.

“Oh, I shouldn’t have left you\!” He held my hand, pressing it against his head as he knelt by the bed. I could smell something familiar coming from him. It was a smell I knew all too well; the smell of blood.

“You must be my father.”

“Oh my Goddess it was true\!” His eyebrows scrunched together as he seemed ready to cry. Not expecting him to answer, I looked toward my mother for the answer. She had entered the room after him and was consoling her husband. 

“Say hello to your father, dear.” 

He was a handsome man. His sharp jawline was devoid of hair and his obsidian eyes were looking at me warmly under his jet-black hair. Sweat had come together making small streams running down his face. His broad shoulders covered by the armor looked to be from the result of rigorous training. The same could be said for the other muscle parts. My mother must be a great fisherwoman.

My mother explained to him how after he left for the three-day hunt, she had to call over a priest to heal my sudden illness. My body had rejected the healing magic, but she had still held onto hope, until the priest suggested she prepare for a ritual intended for the dying. And then I opened my eyes. 

“I knew those people were quacks\!” My father bellowed.

“Watch what you are saying\!” 

“Why else would healing magic not work\! They must have sent some unqualified dolt\!” He looked just like one of those demon paintings the temple liked to hang up. I never understood why they hung them up.

“I don’t know either, but please calm down.” She pleaded with him. It was only then that he noticed the situation. Messy armor stained with blood, dirty sweat covering his face, and he stank. He took a moment to collect himself. “So she doesn’t remember anything?”

“I think so, she even asked who I was…” Victoria broke out into a sob. 

“Oh honey, come here. I didn’t mean to make you cry.” Now it was the wife’s turn to be consoled.

I watched them silently, not even a thought came to mind, still I felt my heart sink. Esther, are you watching? How am I supposed to act in this situation?

A new day welcomed me as the rays of sun lit up the room and woke me up. A pleasant smell of plants filled the room. My mother had fallen asleep while taking care of me again. She looked exhausted, although the smile on her sleeping face indicated otherwise. Sitting there under the light, the dust being lit by the light looked like stars dancing around her. I better get better soon.

From the conversations I could hear the last few days, the main topic seemed to be about money. The priest had refused payment, stating that he couldn’t accept payment for something the Goddess herself did. My illnesses had been slowly but surely emptying our funds and Gale, my father, had even started to do odd jobs here and there.

The body felt particularly well today and I decided to snoop around the house a bit. Sneaking past my mother, I went out of the room carefully, making sure not to wake her up. The first thing I wanted to see was a mirror. I still hadn’t seen myself. It was most likely to find a mirror in Esther’s room, I figured. My parent’s bedroom that I have been using since I woke up didn’t have one.

Opening the door, a cozy small room greeted me. A bed, half the size of the one I’ve been using, sat against the wall. A desk with a matching chair was placed under a window pointing towards the forest in the distance. The trees seemed even greener than the ones at the temple. 

I searched around the room and for a mirror but found only some books placed haphazardly on the desk. They were all about plants and their medicinal properties. It was interesting how although I had never seen the type of script used in the books before, I could still understand the writing. Was this also magic? I closed the books.  

My body began sweating and my legs wobbled a bit as I left Esther’s room. The small distance between my parent’s room and Esther’s seemed to stretch indefinitely as I waddled back to bed. I somehow managed to make it back.

Victoria had woken up from the noise and stretched her arms in the air like a cat. 

“Good morning, sweetie. Did you sleep well?” I liked seeing her smile rather than crying. 

I nodded.

“It smells like your father is cooking something delicious.” A mouth-watering aroma had filled the house while I was snooping. Victoria gave me headpats again. It felt nice. 

“Oh dear, you are sweating so much\!”. 

Reflected in the puddle was a face resembling Victoria staring absentmindedly at me. I looked just like a smaller version of her, a small angel. I tried to emulate her smile. It looked weird even in this prettier body.

My body had gotten much better the past week with all the rest and food. Today I finally got permission to venture outside of the house. Yesterday’s rain had soaked the garden behind the house, covering every blade of grass with water droplets. 

“Esther\!” Victoria was calling from the kitchen window, “Want to give me a hand with breakfast?”

“Coming\!”

Standing up too fast got me a bit lightheaded, a feeling which had become far too familiar.

Yesterday, my mother suggested I help her with cooking, giving me some vegetables to cut. All I ever did was lie in bed and read the few books available in the house, even beginning to re-read some of them. I accepted her suggestion readily.

The kitchen had some interesting things. A stone that magically, literally, made water appear. A stone that summoned a controllable fire, making cooking easier than using gas stove tops. I had almost burnt down the temple kitchen when I tried to cook something there for the first time.

“Here cut these carrots into cubes, do you need me to show you how?” It seemed she had gotten used to my amnesia, often asking me whether I knew something or not.

“I think I got it.”

It had been a while since I last held a knife. Folding each of my fingers around the handle. My hand wasn’t the same size as before but I could still feel the weight of the knife. I gave it a few flips, it was a terrible knife.

“Is it too heavy?” My mother asked. 

“No, it’s fine” It was not fine. The balance of the knife was out of whack, making one need to use more energy than necessary. Not to mention the dull and nicked blade edge, catching the morning light as I inspected it.

Despite my inner complaints, I still made quick work on the carrots, cutting them into suitable pieces. The monks at the temple had made me help out in the kitchen. I had originally to make something to give back to the monks, and seeing my knifework, asked me to help in the kitchen whenever I had time. I had a lot of time.

“Did you get better at cutting vegetables?” Oh, I got carried away.

“You must have gotten it from me, my daughter is so talented\!” Victoria gushed and gave me a squeeze.

“Mom, I’m holding a knife.” Mom, mom, mom. I don’t think I will ever get comfortable saying that three-letter word.

“Sorry, sorry, you’re just so lovely\!”

“Are these stars?” Victoria studied one of my pieces. “Pretty cute…”

“I think they taste better as stars.” I placed the knife down, making sure the tip pointed away from us.

“Hmm.” She didn’t agree? “Come here\!” 

A full on hugging attack. “How is my daughter this cute\!” I didn’t really understand Victoria sometimes. Nonetheless, whenever she hugged me with her warm arms I couldn't help but feel a bit happier. 

Setting the table for three, Gale came down the stairs groggily.

“What’s for breakfast today?” He asked, slumbering toward his seat at the end.

“Vegetable stew and fried potatoes”. We were now all seated. “Phew, you better wash up afterwards. I can practically smell the alcohol coming from you, how many did you have yesterday”

“I didn’t even get to take a sip, some guy spilled his whole cup all over me”. He took a spoonful of the stew. “Wow, is it just me or did your cooking get better lately?”

“It’s a secret ingredient I added lately.” My mother smirked mischievously. 

He inhaled the bowl of stew. “Poison is it?”

“What nonsense\! Why would I poison the same food as Esther and I are eating.”

“She didn’t deny it…” Gale murmured to me.

“What you are tasting is the sweat and efforts of our daughter. She has helped me out in the kitchen lately.

“Really? She did feel more mature lately, but to think my child is now all grown up…” Fake-wiping his fake tears, he gave me a few pats. 

“I should give a gift to my now all grown up daughter, say it and it shall be yours.” He said theatrically, eliciting a chuckle out of his wife.

“I don’t really need anything.” 

“She really did go and grow up…” Gale slumped his shoulders. “How about this?” Rummaging through his pockets, he pulled out a silver coin. 

“Isn’t a silver coin a bit much, honey? You could buy a day’s worth of food with that”

“This is nothing, wait until you see this.” Leaving the table, he came back with a book in hand.

“I heard you were interested in monsters.” It was a monster lexicon.

“Whoah.” I could finally see what the monsters looked like.

“So my daughter likes monsters more than money, noted”

“Where do you keep finding these books? Aren’t they expensive?”

“Don’t worry, I got this for less than that silver coin”

Flipping through a few pages, I understood why my mother didn’t worry too much about her husband going out and slaying monsters. Each page had a picture and a description of a monster. A rabbit with antlers, a deer with four eyes and other animals with an assortment of features either added or subtracted. Well, I guess you could call these weird animals monsters.

“Speaking of, you know the people I met yesterday? We are currently figuring out the last details about a really good job. A lot of money is sure to be paid out.

“Really? Who are they?”

He explained how some fancy people from out of town had come here to find something, and needed people to show them the way. They wouldn’t give more details until they finalized the contract. 

“We won’t have to worry about money for a while if my gut instinct is correct\!”

“This sounds too good to be true”, my mother seemed suspicious, “I’ve never heard of guarding duty being well paid”

“Well, by the way she was acting, it seemed like the leader was a noble. *I* would know.”

“That makes sense…”

I guess nobles splurged more money than necessary, they sound rich. Anyway, how should I spend this silver coin?

# Chapter 3: Town

“Hey kid, you want to buy something?”

I was currently standing in front of a toady looking street vendor selling meat skewers. The smell of the skewers had enchanted me, making me arrive at this place. It had been a while since I’ve eaten grilled meat.

“Go ask your parents if you’ve got no money”

“How much for a skewer?” My mother had given me a coin pouch to safely carry the silver coin. It was hand-sewed and the name, Esther, was embroidered on it. 

“Five coppers for one, kid.” 

I was about to open my pouch when I saw something glistening in front of the toady man's mouth. It looked like a circle.

“Sorry, could you repeat that?”

“A kid your age already losing their hearing? I said five, coppers.” A golden circle was hovering in front of the man’s mouth, appearing as if to cover it. The golden circle appeared each time he told me the price.

“What about this one?” I pointed to a skewer with only vegetables.

“Four coppers, scram if you’re not going to buy anything.” It appeared again when he said four. Only I seemed to see it.

“Are you lying about the price?”

The vendor paused for a second. “Lying about the price? Who decided that?”

“Do you want me to buy you one sweetie?” My mother had arrived.

“How much for a skewer?”

“That’ll be three coppers for one.” 

I felt my eyebrows scrunch together as I held the skewer in my hand. Did the toady vendor really lie? Like he said, who decided what was a lie? The golden circle had to be some form of magic. This was too confusing.

Taking my first bite of the skewer filled me with amazement. A bit gamey, but that  only added to the charm. The temple didn’t have that much meat to eat and this tasted different from the dishes Victoria made. 

“Is this meat from the four-eyed deer monster?” I asked her

“You can’t really eat monsters, sweetie.”

“Why not?” I took another cube of meat  into my mouth.

“Monsters were poisoned by the goddess to make it so we wouldn't needlessly hunt them.”

“Really?” I put the last cube in my mouth. “Wouldn’t it be better to hunt them for food?”

“Who knows? Maybe we can ask one of the priests at the church.”

She went on to explain that the church in town was the place to ask about the goddess, the divine or anything monster related. A church didn’t sound like a place where I would be comfortable at. It’s a wonder how I managed to even stay at a temple.

With two empty skewers in one hand, and my mother’s hand in the other, I accompanied her wherever she led me. The sight of the town was quite something. It looked just like a medieval city. Cobblestones laid on our path and carriages with horses could be seen going up and down the streets, clipping and clopping all the while. Passing a bunch of people, we arrived in front of a shop.

The town was pretty developed for being a town on the outskirts, Gale said. There was a social class system used in the Kingdom where the aristocracy held more power than the commoners. At the top of the social pyramid stood the King, he could have ruled the kingdom with an iron fist doing whatever he wanted, hadn't it been for the nobles. The highest ranking nobles were the three dukes who, with the help of several different aristocratic factions, held the king and each other in check. Gale had let out a huge sigh when he had explained.

The noble ruling over this town was Baron Barre, which was also the name of the town. Barre of the Guillain Kingdom. It rolled nicely off the tongue. Gale didn’t seem that happy when talking about him.

“Why don’t you wait on the bench here?” She pointed to a bench set outside the store, shaded by a big leafy tree.

My legs had begun to ache so it was a welcome offer. Sitting on the bench and watching the people walking past me was entertaining enough. There were some guards walking around with spears in their hand patrolling the area, people who were haggling with vendors trying to get the most for their money, I should try doing that next time. Yet what had been the most entertaining was the striking hair colors of the people in this town. Red, blue, green, a bunch of colors littered the heads of the passerbys. Speaking of, a boy with red hair had appeared in front of me.

“What’s a young lady like you doing here? Never seen you here before.”

A young lady, wasn’t that usually used when talking to nobles? Well I did wear a rather pretty dress and fancy sunhat. Victoria had given me one of hers to protect me from the scorching summer sun. Anyway, who is he?

The boy had a tall frame with tanned skin, evidence of him having played outside a lot. He still had some boyness to him as his face didn’t look like a man yet. His green eyes stared at me and his unkempt red hair looked like a hedgehog I had seen once.

“I’m not a young lady, my name is Esther. I’ve never seen you before either”

“Is that so? I’m Eric, I live in that house over there”, he said, pointing at the house next to the shop. “I’m 14”

Is this how you are supposed to introduce yourself?

“I live outside town, I’m 13”

He smirked. “Looks like I’m older than you”

“Are you lost or something?” 

“I’m waiting for my mom.”

“That sounds boring.” The boy took a seat beside me as if it was natural, plopping himself down. He was a whole head higher than me.

“Yeah this is boring, wanna go play instead?” It hadn’t even been a full minute before he said something. 

“My mother said to not go with strangers.” 

Victoria didn’t tell me this but the point still stands, I think. *She* didn't really exude a sense of confidence. Besides, playing? That did sound fun.

“I’m not a stranger, I know your name and you know mine. Oh I know.” He rummaged through his bag, eventually pulling something wrapped in paper.

“My dad told me to give a gift to someone to make them your friend. Here take one”

It was hard-candy. I hadn’t had sugar in a while, it was supposed to be pretty rare so how did this kid get some? Not passing up this opportunity, I unwrapped one and popped it into my mouth. My mouth felt like it was burning as the sweetness enveloped my mouth. 

He smiled. “There, we’re now friends”

“Is that how that works?” I snuck another piece into my mouth.

“Hey, don't take all of them\!” Tsk, he took them away.

“Don’t click your tongue at me…”

“Who’s this, Esther? A new friend?” My mother was finished with her shopping.

“Yeah, he gave me some candy".

“Did he now? Well thank you for that”. Victoria gave him a smile.

“O-oh it was no problem, my lady. My name is Eric. I live over there”. He was already on his feet, his face turning red like his hair.

“Oh my\! My lady?” She looked happy.

He had a dumb expression on his face. “Mom, can I go play with Eric for a bit?”

“Hmm” She turned to look at the guards. “Make sure to meet us by the fountain on the next bell, okay? Eric, can I offer you this mission?”

“Of course\!”

“Eric, let's go.”

“Huh? Oh, sure”

Eric went after me after giving my mother a farewell. I saw that she was waving at us when I turned around. My cheeks filled with air as I walked a little bit faster. 

“Hey where are you going, that’s the wrong way”

“Really? I don’t even know where I am going.”

“Weirdo.” Eric gave me a funny look. “This way. All the kids play over there.”

Snaking around some alleys and streets, we arrived into a clearing, where a group of kids were chatting and running around.

“Hey guys\! A brought another one to play with”

“Eric\!” a girl in shorts came running up to us. “I told you to stop bringing over random kids\!”, she said grumpily.

“She’s not some random kid, I befriended her with some candy. Isn’t that fine? She looked pretty bored so I took her along.” Rubbing his nose, it looked like he thought he did something heroic. I wasn’t actually bored.

“That’s not the correct way to befriend someone\!” She sounded exasperated. 

The girl let out a sigh. “Ugh, well what’s done is done. I’m Karrie by the way”. 

My sunhat was blocking me from seeing her face. Tilting my head to move it out of the way, a sight I had not expected greeted me.

“What? What are you doing here?” 

“Ann?”

“Who’s that, I said my name was Karrie.”

“You know her?” Eric asked.

“She’s my neighbor. Did you get sick again? Haven’t seen you around lately.”

Chestnut-brown hair done in a short bob, a pair of brown eyes and above them, two thin eyebrows framing her round face. A vivid image of her laying in a casket filled my head. There was no mistaking it, she had a different name but this was definitely her. 

“Hello? You home?” A hand appeared in front of me, waving back and forth.

“Oh, sorry. Nice to meet you, I’m Esther. I live outside of town”. 

“What kind of greeting is that supposed to be? And I already know who you are.” Tilting her head to the side. Her eyebrows seemed to question me. “Is this some kind of a new joke?”

“Sorry it wasn’t a joke. I lost my memories a few days ago, so I don't remember anyone.”

“Are you joking? How’s that possible”

“I don’t know, the priest said he didn’t know either.”

“You called a priest? Must have been serious then…” She crossed her arms.

“Whoah, that's so cool\!” Jumping into the conversation was a cheerful looking Eric.

“So you don’t remember anything?” I nodded to his question.

“What about your parents, did you remember them?”

“Hey\! What are you saying\!” Seeing her slap Eric on the back resurfaced some old memories. 

“When I woke up, I just saw this pretty lady looking at me.” 

“Yeah that’s right, she’s really pretty\!”. Eric said, rubbing his back. Tsk.

“Hey, stop clicking your tongue at me\! What did I do now?”

Eric continued. “Well? And then what happened?”

“Hey quit it, look how sad she is getting\!”

Sad? Me? Well this works out. The golden magic circle thingy had nagged at me and with Ann popping up, I could investigate them both.

“Ann, do you know what happened on Earth?”

She was silent, only looking at me. 

Her mouth finally opened. “Oh.” Was she also reincarnated? “You were talking to me? I don’t know this erf thing you are talking about, but my name is Karrie.”

No magic circle appeared. How could this be? She was definitely Ann. I couldn’t forget her face even if I wanted to. 

“Are we going to play or what?” Eric said.

“Ah, that’s right, let's do something fun\!” Ann- Karrie said.

“We? You gonna ditch the others?”

“They only do tiring stuff, the weather is too hot today. I don’t want to get sweaty. You know anything interesting to do, Esther?” Right the circle must not be detecting lies after all.

“Esther? Hello?” 

“Oh, sorry, I don’t remember.”

“Wow… I bet you say that often.” Eric said incredulously. Karrie glanced at me and nodded.

Ridiculous as it sounds, it was the truth, or more correctly, I didn’t know any games. Having never had the chance to play with others, remembering games or fun things to do was just wasted energy I could instead use to survive. Well, there was one activity I was often a part of.  

“How about truth or dare?” I spat out.

“You serious?” They said in tandem.

“It was a joke”, was what I wanted to say as an excuse, however before I could let out the words exit my mouth, a golden magic circle had formed in front of it, blocking me from speaking.

She really wasn’t Ann?

# Chapter 4: Playing

“Well I see you still make bad jokes…” She sighed.

“That sounds fun, let's try it\!” Eric agreed to the game I said on impulse. “Maybe we can help her remember things.”

“And what if she only chooses dare?”

“I didn’t think that far…”

The magic circle had dissipated. It had slowly faded into the air into nothingness, letting me speak again. I didn’t really want to play this game, it was never fun, but I figured I could use this opportunity to investigate whether that was Ann or not. She wouldn’t be able to figure out who I am, my face and body was completely different. I don’t think I even need to lie or tell the truth this time.

“Let’s play truth or dare then.”

Eric nodded. “Yes\! You can start, Esther, since you were the one who chose it.”

I turned to Karrie. “Truth or dare.” She picked ‘truth’.

“Is it true that your favorite color is red?” 

“Yes, how did you know?” I shrugged. There was no golden circle this time.

“Okay, my turn. Eric, truth or dare?” 

“I will pick dare of course.” He looked confident.

“I dare you to climb that tree over there, give me a leaf.” The tree she pointed at was at least two stories high. 

“Pfft\! That’s easy\!” Eric stood in front of the tree, its width as high as he was tall. He climbed the tree as fast as he went down, holding a big leaf in his hand.

“Here you go.” He handed the leaf to an open-mouthed Karrie.

“What\! How did you do that\! That was so fast\!” She bounced up and down excitedly.

“Hmm hmm, I’m the fastest in this town you know?” Eric puffed out his chest as Karrie and I showered him with praises. Then he picked me to choose ‘truth or dare’. I picked ‘truth’ of course, my body was getting sore.

“Whats your mother’s favorite food?” Her favorite food that’s easy. Carrot stew.

“...\!” What? Why did it show up?

“\!\!\!”

“You don’t remember? I didn’t know it was that bad…”

“No wait, it’s …” No way.

“Esther, you shouldn’t push yourself that hard.” Karrie seemed concerned. Why would *she* look concerned? 

“I know it\! I just can’t say it\!

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I tried to say something else but it didn’t let me. It just blocked my mouth and dazzled. The thing couldn’t even be touched.

I heard them whisper. “Eric, maybe we should change games, she looks really angry…”

“Yeah…” Why were they whispering?

“Esther, how about we play something else?” I see how it is, just because I can’t answer your stupid questions you want to change the game?

“No\! I want to play truth or dare\!” You were always like this.

“Uhm, how about we change the question then, Eric can you-”

“Why should he change his question\! Stop getting in my way\!”

“Esther, I changed my question.”

“Shut up\! The answer is—”

“What is your favorite food”

“—carrot soup\!” What? 

Only the background noise of rustling trees and kids playing could be heard as I tried to understand what had just happened. They just stood there.

“What? My favorite food is carrot soup?” 

“Eshter, are you really okay? I know you always get sick but maybe you should rest for a bit?”

“Okay…” Karrie was looking at me just like Victoria did and Eric hadn’t said anything ever since I yelled out my favorite food. I dragged my body toward the tree Eric had climbed, and took a seat in its shadow. It was cold. I hugged my knees to try to warm up a bit.

The two of them ended up playing with the other kids for a while, before coming back to check up on me. Eric had offered another piece of candy to which I accepted, however it didn’t taste that sweet this time, it was just, sour.

“Do you want to play rock paper scissors?” Karrie suggested. 

I must have really looked terrible if we had to resort to playing that. She bounced her hand two times and on the third bounce, I threw out scissors. 

“I win.” Karrie had thrown out paper, she always did that.

“Let me join the next round.” Eric smiled again.

We sat under the tree and played a couple more rounds. Throwing out my hand this much had warmed up my body a bit. The bell rang in the distance as I noticed the sun hanging a little lower than it did before. 

“Aw shucks, I lost” Eric threw himself down on the grass, laying on his back.”

“You’re really good at this Esther. It was like you already knew what we were going to throw.” Karrie said. 

“Are you saying I know magic?” Eric didn’t have a poker face and I already knew Karrie’s thought pattern. “You guys sound like sore losers.” 

“You know magic?” Eric said from below, ignoring that last part.

“I don’t think I do. How can you check?”

“You just know it?” I thought back on the dozen golden circles. Was that magic? 

“A priest should know if they use their magic on you.”

“Can I be healed if I have magic?”

“Of course you can”, Karrie said. “Healing magic works on everyone, I heard your body shines in your favorite color if you have the ability to use magic\!”

“But nothing has shined from my body yet…” She drooped her shoulders.

“You know a lot about magic, Karrie. Did you want to be one?” Eric looked at her.

“Of course\! Who wouldn’t want to be a cool mage.”

“I would rather be a knight.”

“That’s because you are stupid.”

He flew up from the ground. “I’m not stupid\!”

“Yes you are\! That's why she won\!”

While they were having their little squabble, the other kids had already wrapped up their games and left the plaza. I began to also leave, dragging my feet toward the meeting point Victoria had told me. I missed her. The two others began following me as I approached the alleys, they all looked the same. 

“Esther”, Eric called out.

“What is it?”

“Thats the wrong way. The fountain is this way.” I saw him smirk.

“Oh, I thought you were taking a shortcut, Esther. So sorry.” My cheeks felt hot as I turned and followed them instead.

With Eric leading the way, the three of us began our journey through the alleys. Chatting along the way were the two of them, their topics ranged from this to that. Occasionally, I gave an affirmative “Yes” or “I see” pretending to listen as I focused all my strength in my feet instead. They were beginning to hurt.

“Hey did you hear about the Executioner? How dead people keep popping up?” I turned my ears towards Eric.

“I did see that there were more guards than usual lately, is that why?” 

“Finn said that his dad would give a huge reward to the person that caught him.” 

“Really? Why doesn’t he just catch them himself? Isn’t he the captain?” Karrie put her hand to her chin. “How much are we talking about?”

“He said thirty gold coins\!” Eric gestured with his hands.

“Oh my goddess.” Was that a huge sum? “And you really believed him?”

“Well…”

She shrugged. “I can’t remember the last time that daddy’s boy said something that was true.”

“You do have a point.” He copied Karrie’s hand gesture.

The fountain came into view as we rounded the corner. Victoria was already there with Gale, the two of them talking to a woman. She wore pants, which I hadn’t seen a woman use in a while, and a big cape. Her light blue hair was also cut short, only reaching her chin. She looked pretty with that unusual hairdo.

“Miss Victoria\!” Karrie shouted. “We brought Esther back”

Having heard her name being called, she turned toward us three. She smiled when her gaze met mine. I could hear Eric mumble my mothers name in front of me. Tsk.

“Goodness, there’s a whole group of you now.” 

“Oh my, how cute. Are these all your children?” The short haired woman asked.

“As if, one is more than enough for us.” Gale crouched down, meeting me at my eye level. “Did you make new friends already today?”

“Yeah, this is Eric and Karrie. But I think Karrie was already my friend.”

The woman looked at me and then at my mother. “The resemblance is uncanny. Nice to meet you, I’m Raviel.” She gave me a bow. 

“Hello, I’m Esther, I live out of town. I’m thirteen.” I bowed back, which got a chuckle out of her. Was there something funny?

“I suppose it is time for the children to head back, should we meet again to finalize the contract?” Gale confirmed and Raviel left us, blending through the crowd of people.

“Aw shucks, I’m gonna get scolded again\! Bye guys, and see you Lady Victoria\!” Eric left while waving toward my mother.

“Lady Victoria? Did that boy just..?” Yes he did, Gale.

My mother waved back. “What a charming boy.” 

“Karrie, did you go out alone again? Do you want to head back with us today?” Karrie glanced shyly at my mother and nodded.

With Karrie and I at the front, we began our journey back home. It was amazing how much Karrie could talk. My ear nearly fell off, still at least she looked happy chatting away. If only she could hear my inner turmoil.

Was Ann or Karrie? She wasn’t Ann at the moment, yet her face was. It was fun playing with them today, I had a good time. *It wouldn’t hurt to just observe her*. Her mouth was opening and closing rapidly, letting the words flow out.

We finally arrived at her house. It looked similar to ours, which stood there in the distance, even the tree in the backyard stood in a similar position.

“See ya Esther\! I will definitely win next time, let’s play again\!”

My parents said farewell to her mother, who had come outside to scold her tomboy daughter. They seemed to know each other well, promising to visit should there be time for it. 

“Was she one of those people who had that idea you were talking about?”

He adjusted the grip on the bag of stuff. “Raviel?” Gale explained that Raviel’s employer had apparently found a treasure map of some kind and needed some experienced people that knew the lay of the land. He boasted that no one knew this place better than him. The employer had apparently found him because of this boasting. 

I don’t know about this idea of hers, doesn’t it sound suspicious? Such a high sum just to guide some people…”

“That’s just how they are. How about this?” He took her hand. “I will tell my men to immediately run should I sense anything dangerous. This job is too lucrative to give up.” He planted a kiss on the back of her hand. 

“I’m really sorry for making you always do all this work…”

“Nothing to be sorry about, I married you didn’t I?” I saw my mother blush while the red evening sun shone behind her.

Getting tucked in by my mother became a routine of sorts after I moved rooms. Although it still felt awkward as I laid there, hiding half of my face under the blanket, while she looked over me.

“Did you have fun today?” I nodded.

I had made a commotion when my legs suddenly gave out and Gale had to carry me the rest of the way. She had fretted around the house blaming herself for not taking better care of me. It wasn’t until her husband comforted her saying that none of it was her fault. A child had to fall down to learn how to pick themself up, he said. My mother patted my belly as she sat there with a gentle expression. 

“I played truth or dare today.”

“Really?”

“But it wasn't any fun… So we played rock paper scissors instead.” My eyes felt heavier as Victoria kept patting my belly. 

“I won, they didn’t even have a chance.”

“Of course my daughter won. Why, she must be the best at rock paper scissors in the world.” She gave my forehead a kiss.

Her mood always changed whenever something happened to me. Happy when she saw that I finished my meal. Sad when I looked exhausted from moving around. It was apparent even to me how much she loved her daughter. I wonder what I have to do to not make her make that sad expression anymore.

She left the room when I could no longer open my eyes. A lot had happened today. I ate grilled meat, stole– ate some candy Eric had given me, and met Karrie. It was honestly shocking seeing her but she was fun to be around. It had been a long time since I've had fun with others. 

A sudden realization shook off my drowsiness as I opened my eyes wide. Laying on top of my desk was my coin pouch, it still had a silver coin in it. I forgot to spend my money\! Tomorrow, I would spend some money tomorrow, whatever it took.

# Chapter 5: Church

Sitting on the prayer bench, my eyes lost its focus staring at the hand-crafted marble statue. The sides of my dress had become wrinkled by how hard I clenched my hands. Today was the day of the Goddess, the seventh day of the week. 

I had my whole day planned out. First, wear something comfortable. After that, go to town, maybe with Karrie if she wanted to and then use the whole day to go find something interesting to spend my money on. My mother had woken me up as usual, however this morning she told me to get ready for church. I glanced up at the statue of the goddess with her smug expression.

The sight of statues was starting to really annoy me. Did they all really need to make the same face? Why can’t they just be faceless or have a mask on. At least make their eyes closed. The sunlight shone through the stained glass window, draping its colors across the hall. I sat where the red light shone, the perfect spot for the statue to look down at me. My dress would get ripped if I didn’t control myself.

“And onto us the Goddess bestowed these five commands\!” The headpriest doing the sermon shouted something familiar. He was a middle aged man wearing an all white garment, the only other color being the golden scarf thing. A stole I think it was called.

He went on to explain the five rules one had to follow to not be damned: Killing, theft, adultery, lying, and intoxication. What? It was the same as the five precepts the monks used to tell me. Wasn’t it a unique concept? I thought back to what the monks had said to me once.  

“Do you know why drinking is the last thing to be mentioned? That’s because it’s the most important one.” The monk said.

“Why isn’t killing the worst thing? That would make more sense.” 

“Hmm, let me tell you a story then.

There once was a young monk going around begging for food. This was a task assigned by his master as a form of study. It wasn’t a simple task to beg for food. Knocking on the doors of houses, silence would greet him more often than not. 

One time, someone had given the monk a jug of wine, they had no water to give. The monk had never taken a sip of alcohol before, he had been raised in the temple. Feeling thirsty, he took a sip, and then a glug, and finally the whole jug was gone. He felt full.

Walking down the street he was getting hungry from drinking. The young monk spotted a plump chicken in someone’s backyard. Passing through the fence, he took the chicken and slaughtered it. There was a coal grill in the backyard and so he began grilling it. He felt full.

The houseowner heard the commotion in their backyard and angrily yelled at the monk for stealing her chicken. The monk had never seen such a beautiful woman before in his life, and before he knew it, he had committed adultery. He felt full.

Returning back to his temple, the master asked him if he had done something other than go beg for food. No, he replied. The master looked upon the young monk. He felt full of sadness.

“How about it? Do you see why it is mentioned last? A drunk person will easily lose reason and do whatever their inner instincts tell them to do.”

“I don’t know. Would some alcohol really make someone do all that?”

The monk chuckled. “You may still be a bit too young to understand”

\*\*\*

“May you all be blessed\!” The booming voice snapped me out of my thoughts. The sermon had ended and the dozens of people started streaming out of the church. I followed my parents the opposite way.

“What a surprise to see you here today, Mr. Gale. Did something good happen?” The headpriest smiled.

I noticed Gale clench his fist. “Good to see you too, Father.” A big golden circle appeared. I turned to see if the priest saw it, no reaction. 

“We were wondering if we could meet with the priest who paid us a visit a few days ago?”

“Straight to the core of the matter as always.” The priest closed the holy book slowly, not making a sound, then with quiet steps, sauntered around the altar. 

“What’s with the hastiness? How about we chat over a cup of tea?” He motioned to the door at the back. 

“Thank you for the offer, but we don’t want to take up more of your time than necessary”

The priest stood still for a moment, still smiling. “What a shame I just got these new tea leaves, it's not often you get things from the capital here you know?” He paused for a second. 

“You must be talking about Father Lawrence who joined us recently, speaking of which, he consulted with me on an interesting matter of his.” He turned and stared at me. His jovial expression still plastered on his face. 

“Hmm, I see.”

I noticed something gold flicker in his eyes as Gale stepped forward, blocking his sight. 

“Sorry about, a force of habit”. He pulled out a bag from the altar. “Do you want some raisins?”

“No thanks”, I said.

“Like father, like daughter.” He chuckled to himself.

“Well, then. He should be in the library.” The priest opened the door, motioning us to follow.

“He is still unpleasant as ever.” He sighed. “This won’t take long.” Gale left, leaving my mother and I behind.

My mother bent down to talk to me. “Want to go visit the courtyard? I heard they got some new pretty flowers\!”

The smell of flowers tickled my nose as I strolled around the courtyard holding my mothers hand. Roses the size of my hand and other flowers in all kinds of colors lit up the well-trodden path. 

“I wonder if we could take some home with us”, she studied the peonies, “don’t you think it would spruce up our home, Esther?”

I nodded. A golden circle had appeared before my mouth. I hated flowers. I couldn’t care less about them. They cost too much and their fragrant smell made me feel sick. I had seen enough of them already. Maybe I should ask the priest if he knew something about this annoying thing.

We sat on a bench after my mother was done with her flower-gazing. The gray church stood like a castle in the courtyard.

I turned to Victoria “Mom, would you rather I had my memories back?”

“What are you talking about sweetie?” She furrowed her brows.

“Isn’t that why we are at the church? To ask for a cure?”

“Well…” She took a moment to say the next words. “You know we will always love you, right?”

I nodded.

“We just felt that you may be a bit frustrated not knowing all the things your father and I are talking about.”

“I’m not.” I turned away from her gaze. “It’s kinda fun learning new things everyday”.

I didn’t need to look to figure out what expression she had, she had wrapped her arms around me and gave me a hug.

“Esther\!” Someone shouted my name.

“Let’s play\!” It was Karrie, wearing a dress this time. Her pale shoulders peeked above her dress. I got permission to play for a bit and went over to where Karrie was waving. 

“Are you still getting hugs at your age?” 

“What’s wrong with that, I like them.”

“Wow… Gross…” She rubbed her shoulders. “I can’t believe how different you are now…”

“Really, how did I act before?”

“Uhm”, she hesitated, “it didn’t look like you liked you mom that much”

“That’s ridiculous, was I stupid or something?”

“Yeah, I thought so too\! Your mom is ten times nicer than mine.”

Karrie told me more things about Esther, how she behaved, how she talked, and how she never looked to really have fun whenever she played, always having a sad or tired expression on her face. Karrie seemed to like this version of Esther a lot more.

“Hey, let's go find some cool insects.”

“Insects? How do you find them?”

“Oh right, you just need to find a really big rock and lift it.” She motioned with her hands. “I saw some really big ones behind the church\!”

Following her, I turned around and looked at my mother. Her hair was gently swaying in the cool wind and she had her eyes closed with a peaceful expression. I should let her sleep some more.

“This one will do.” Karrie gripped a decently sized rock and turned it over. Dozens of insects scrawled around as their roof had disappeared. A big worm squirmed there on the dirt. It twirled and twirled as if trying to become a ball before deciding to rather be a stick. It was disgusting. Why don’t you just dig in the dirt if you’re getting burned by the sun? You incompetent worm. I’m glad I didn’t reincarnate into this stupid thing. 

I grabbed a nearby stick and stabbed it in its thick part. It went unscathed, my stick only pressing it into the dirt helping it find cover from the sun. I stabbed it again and again. There was a small hole where it had squirmed. It had disappeared. I couldn’t even kill this single insignificant worm. 

“Whoah, look at that beetle\!”

The outside rushed back into my senses. Karrie pointed with a stick at a beetle.

“I bet ya it will stink twice as much”, she said chirpily before upturning rock after rock, looking for an even bigger beetle. I didn’t see how she could enjoy herself.

“What are you dumb girls doing?” Someone interrupted our playing.

Strutting toward us was a tall moss-headed boy and another boy trailing behind him.

“Ugh, it’s Finn and his lackey”

“Who’s that?”

“Someone annoying, just ignore them.” She turned away from them.

“Hey\! I asked you a question\!” Moss-boy demanded

The other boy spoke up. “Bro, why are we even talking to them? Let’s go find some cool sticks\!”

“I don’t care about some dumb sticks\!” He suddenly roared. 

“But you said-” Finn threw his hand over the other boy’s mouth.

Karrie sighed. “What do you want?” Her voice contrasted her earlier cheery tone. 

“You\!” The green boy pointed at her. “Why are you hanging out with Esther?”

“It’s nonya”

“What’s nonya?” The other boy asked.

“None of ya business\!” Karrie guffawed.

“Thats not funny\!” 

Crossing his arms he turned to me. “Esther, you shouldn’t hang out with her.” Who was he to tell me what to do?

“Why not?”

“She’s a bad person\! Don’t you remember how she spread the rumours?”

“What rumours?” 

“Hey\!-” Karrie tried to interrupt him. 

“That you are always pretending\!”

“Stop\!”

“That the only reason we play with you is because you are pretty\!”

I looked toward Karrie, he had spoken the truth.

“Esther, I didn’t really mean to-”

“Yeah right.” Finn interrupted. “You are only pretending to hang out with her aren’t you. You probably have some other evil plan to make Esther sad again. You are a bad person, Karrie.” Karrie looked like a beaten up puppy as he barraged her with comments. He looked proud. That image irritated me, she was my friend.

“You shouldn’t hang out with those types of people.” He reached his hand toward me. 

“I didn’t believe those rumours at all you know?” He lied. 

“You should hang out with someone with a good personality like me instead” His cheeks reddened a little as he said that. 

Is that how it works? He didn’t look like a person with a good personality. Actually, in the short time I saw and heard him, I thought the opposite to be true.

“No thanks.” I said flatly. Finn’s hand dropped a little. “I’d rather play with Karrie.”

“What? Why?” 

“Because you are stupid, and your personality sucks.” Finn and the boy looked shocked. 

“What? Esther, I’m trying to help you out here\!”

“Yeah, Finn is the smartest out of all of us\!” The other stupid boy said stupidly.

“Why are you getting angry? I should be angry at you for even talking to me.”

“Esther…” Karrie said meekly.

“I’m not getting angry\!” The circle dazzled. “My dad said getting angry is only for weak people\!”

“Is that right, then you must be both angry and stupid. And your dad must be stupid too\!” I felt my blood rushing in my veins.

“Don’t call my dad stupid\!” My vision yanked upward towards the sky. The front of my shoulders hurt but the impact on the back of my head made that seem small in comparison. He had shoved me to the ground. 

“Hey\! Why did you do that\!”

“I-I didn’t mean to\!”

“Bro, let's just get out of here\!” 

They scurried away while I grabbed my head. I’ve had enough. Everything irritated me. Irritating statues, irritating gold circles, and irritating people. 

I turned to Karrie standing above me. She was shouting at them. “You cowards\! Why are you running\! Come back here\!”

“Karrie.”

“Oh, Esther, are you okay?” She had a conflicted expression on her face as she helped me up.

“I’m really sorry…” 

“Why are you sorry? They should be the ones saying sorry.” My voice growled.

“It’s my fault you got pushed… and I said those things about you…”

I stared into her downcast eyes. “Karrie, the truth is, I’m not the real Esther. So you don’t need to feel guilty for what you said about her.”

Karrie’s eyes blew up like a pair of plates.

“What?” She looked shocked. 

“What a bad joke…”

# Chapter 6: 

I felt like this situation had happened before.  

“It’s not a joke.” I felt the wind in my sails disappear a little.

Karrie took a deep breath. “Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Esther, but I did really say those things about you…” she scrunched her nose.

“The truth is, I’ve always wanted to be friends with you, but it was hard to talk to you…” She bowed her head. “I want to apologize\!”

The wind disappeared completely. I stood frozen as I stared at the top of her head. Being on the receiving end of an apology was weird. I had always been me on the other side. Her hair rustled in the cool summer wind.

“Ugh, this is so embarrassing\!” Karrie lifted her head, her cheeks red like beets. “Just say whether you accept it or not\!”  

“Oh. Sorry, I accept your apology.” Was that how you did it?

“No\! Now it just sounds like I forced you\!” Karrie seemed to struggle with something as she hid her face behind her hands.

I stared at her face. “It’s fine Karrie. I want to be friends with you too”

“Really?” She peeked between her fingers. “Even when I said those things about you?”

“Don’t worry about it, you didn’t talk about me”

“Yeah right…”

“More importantly, where does Finn live?”

Karrie opened her eyes wide. “Why? Are you going to demand an apology? No chance.”

“What are you talking about, I just don’t want his stupidity spreading to me. I need to know where he lives to do that.”

Karrie let out a chuckle, joining me in throwing insults at him, before telling me what his address was.

“I see”, I gave her the biggest smile I could muster. “Thanks”.

\*\*\*  
The sound of metal being hit by hammers could be heard piercing through the background noise containing the clinking of the armored people, and the chatter of people promoting their wares. Black smoke bloomed atop the chimneys of the blacksmiths making the air feel a little stifling.

“This ain’t no place for a younging like you to go play around”. A sooty old man said to me. “Where are you parents, kid”.

The shop was filled to the brim with weapons and armors, all laid messily in crates or barrels, except for a few hanging on the wall or in display cases. 

“Did you make all the knives yourself?” They looked really well made lying there on display.

The man crossed his arms. “Knives? Never have I ever– these are *daggers.*”

I tilted my head. “What’s the difference?” 

Looking exasperated, he staggered around the counter to face me. I had to crane my neck to look at him. 

“The difference, young lady, is that daggers are used for killing things”. Picking up one of the *daggers,* he took a few stabs at the air.

“I see.”

“Understood? Now go along, before you hurt yourself–”

“How much for this one?” I pointed to a simple looking dagger.

He frowned. “Didn’t you hear me? These are for killing things.” He looked me up and down. 

He gave me a new glance, looking me up and down. I stared back.

“Two gold coins” No golden circle, it was the correct price.

I opened the bag Victoria had bought for me. It looked like a pocketbook.  

“Do you have anything for one silver?”

He clicked his tongue. “Check that pile over there, rejects, the lot of them.”

The box was piled in the dozens with either bent products or half-finished projects.  

“Made ‘em in my apprentice days”

“Must be really old then.” I remarked.

“I see you got humour in you, kid.”

He picked the most decent thing out for me. It was a dagger made of a single piece of metal, it looked like a big toothpick. 

Holding it in my hand I gave it a few swings and stabs. The old man let out an impressed whistle seeing my movements. The dagger felt good in my hand. This would do.

“You seem to really like it.” He appeared to be enjoying himself.

I tried giving him my silver coin but he stopped me, shooing me with his hand. 

“Take it, it’s just scrap metal to me. I don’t know what a young girl like you needs with a dagger, just make sure to not get hurt.” 

He wasn’t as grumpy as I thought. Putting the dagger in my pocketbook, I gave him a curtsy I learnt from Victoria and went on my merry way. Karrie was waiting for me at the end of the street. 

Our family had met up with hers at the church and suggested having a bite together in town. While the adults talked about adult things, Karrie and I scurried off together to look at cool things. 

“I don’t get why you wanted to look around here, Esther. It’s so noisy and it stinks.” 

She turned to her left. “And why are you here?”

“You guys looked to do something fun\!” Eric had spotted us walking around. 

“All’s fun with you isn't it?” She let out a sigh. “Are you done with this place, Esther?”

I nodded.

“Nice\! Let’s go check out that huge crowd over there\! I heard even the Baron has come\!” Eric said excitedly. 

Dragging us along, he told us about the killer that had been terrorising the townspeople for the past few weeks. Whenever there was a gathering of guards, it would mean a body had popped up. The people were starting to get used to it. A green haired, in better armor than the other guards, could be seen directing the others. He must be Finn’s father.

The guards had linked together to make a semi-circle around the point of interest, barring all entry to the onlookers. There was a man kneeling on the ground surrounded by flowers, he seemed to be a farmer judging by his clothes. His back sat straight as he cradled the object in his arms; it stared at me. A pair of open lifeless eyes stared at me. Where his head should have been, stood only a neck stump. A flower had been pressed down his throat. A white lily, stained with drops of blood. The man had been decapitated and displayed like a piece of art. It was pretty.

“How horrible…” A woman from the crowd gasped.

“Tsk, of course it's another one of us.” Another shabbily dressed man spat.

“Goddess, please protect us from this demon\!” An old woman broke out into prayer, mirroring the decapitated man. The blood had pooled on the rough cobblestones underneath, making me wonder if the roses were originally white or red. It painted a picturesque scene. It looked almost religious. 

Covering my face in my hands, I could feel the corners of my face twitch.

“Eric, I’m about to puke… Why did you bring us here?” Karrie’s face was white like a sweet piece of marshmallow. I imagined squeezing her soft face. 

“I thought it would be cool…” Why are you biting your lips Eric? This is cool\! You don’t need to frown okay? 

“You okay Esther?” She patted my back as I stood there hiding my face. 

Sorry Ann, I don’t want to see your face right now. And I don’t want you to see mine either. I crouched down to hide myself. 

“My lord\! We have to hire more guards\!” The mossy man talked to the chubby man.

“Uhm, aren’t there enough of you? The finances were a little tight right now…” Oh, Mr. Baron, why are you lying? 

“Enough of us?\! This has been the fourth time The Executioner has struck you know\!”

“How is that my problem? You are the captain of the guards, just go arrest the damned man.” 

“And how are we supposed to do that with only thirty of us\!”

“That sounds like a lot to me.”

Murmurs could be heard from the crowd but I couldn’t focus.

“Eric, I don’t think Esther should be here any longer, we should go back.”

“Yeah, sorry…”

\*\*\*

“Hello kids, you look like you’ve seen a ghost or something\!” Karrie’s father guffawed. 

“Uh, yeah, ha ha.” Eric replied.

Sitting around the table were our parents chatting away. 

“What happened?” Victoria asked us. 

Seeing that Karrie and Eric didn’t have anything to say, I spoke up. “Do ghosts really exist?”

“‘Course they do\! Why, I saw one myself this one time\!” He was loud, but surprisingly truthful.

His wife let out a sigh. “There he goes again…” 

“Come sit with me, Esther.” Victoria picked me up and put me on her lap. Karrie looked to be envious of me. 

“Oh, yeah?” Gale asked. “And then what did you do?”

“What did I do? Well I ran of course.”

His wife let out another sigh. “I don’t understand why you are telling other people about your cowardice…”

“Nonsense\! It’s not cowardice, it's called being smart. Think”, he tapped his head with a finger, “how am I supposed to beat up a ghost? I don't even know how to use magic\!” He looked proud as he pointed his nose in the air.

“Speaking of, what happened to that job of yours?”

“Ugh, don’t even mention it.” Gale leant back into his chair crossing his arms. “They suddenly cancelled it, saying some nonsense about it being too dangerous and we weren’t the right fit.

“Hah, if you’re not the right fit then I wonder who is?”

“Right? Although it’s getting worrisome how this isn’t the first time the job’s been cancelled. Gale threw his hand in the air. “What must one do to get a decent paying job around here?”

Victoria fed me one of the bits of food on the table, it was tasty. “I’m just glad nothing dangerous happened”. Eric and Karrie looked stupid sitting there.

“It did sound suspicious." Karrie’s mother remarked. “I tell you, all men must think they are invincible.”  

“It adds to their charm don’t you think?” She covered her pretty mouth as she gave out a small laugh. 

“It’s a wonder how you two are still in your honeymoon phase…” She glanced at her husband. He shrugged.

“Maybe they got scared off by the Executioner?” He said. Oh, they both flinched at the same time upon hearing the moniker.

“What a horrid name, they still haven’t catched them?” Gale replied.

“Well, you know how our lord likes to do things” He pointed his chin towards where the Barons manor stood.

Clicking his tongue, Gale chugged down the rest of his cup. “They always prioritise the wrong things, those nobles. What happened to noblesse oblige?”

“That nobles had the duty to protect us commoners? Ha, you really believe in that nonsense?”

The four adults continued to chat with each other until it was time to head home. Eric promised to do something more fun next time and apologized to Karrie and I. Karrie gave him a smack on his back, telling him it was fine. And me? I didn’t mind, I had better things to think about. 

Tonight. Tonight? *Tonight.*

# Chapter 7: Finn

Hearing something plink at his window, Finn woke up after the third time it happened. With heavyset feet, he shuffled to the window, opening it. He thought it was one of the boys always hanging out with him. Instead, under his window stood someone wholly unexpected. It was Esther. Her golden hair glistened in the moonlight. She was about to throw another pebble until she noticed him.

“Ah, there you are." She said cheerfully.

“Esther? What are you doing here?” It was in the middle of the night.

“Come down, I want to talk with you”

“Right now?” Finn had also wanted to talk to her. He didn’t mean to shove her and wanted to apologise, his father said that a man had to do that if they hurt a woman. 

“Give me a second.” He whispered loudly.

What did she want to talk about? Did she finally get hurt by that girl again? That must be it. She had acted like she wasn’t interested, yet she showed up in his backyard. His heart rate rose a bit higher and with a light gait left his room. He listed down the stairs; careful not to wake up his dad, and finally arrived at the front door. 

Grabbing the door handle and slowly turning it, the mechanism in the door began to operate, making it ring out clicking noises. It reverberated across the entrance. In the slight gap he managed to open, stood a silhouette. Esther was already in front of the door, waiting, smiling. Finn couldn’t help but let out a yelp as she had been closer than he thought. 

“Did I scare you?” Her crescent moon shaped eyes sparkled in the darkness like small sapphires.

“Not really…” Finn thought she really was pretty.

“Come follow me\!” The words flowing from her soft lips felt almost enchanting. Ordering him to follow after her.

“Where are we going?” They were heading into the forest out back.

“Just a bit further?” She said without turning. Her golden hair flowed like wings under the bright full moon, shining beautifully. It was like he was following a fairy.

“What do you mean?” They had walked quite the distance. “What did you want to talk about?” 

He felt his heart thumping in his mouth. They finally stopped. Standing in the middle of the moonlit forest was Him and Esther. His father had often played with him in this very forest, sometimes even camping through the night, saying a knight must know how to sleep outside. He was fond of his dad, he wanted to be just like him. Esther turned around, her smile shone brighter than even the moon above.

“This looks like a good spot”

“A spot for what?” His heart was thumping like it wanted to jump out of his mouth. 

“I have a confession I want to make.” She hid her dainty hands behind her back. 

Oh, my goddess, a confession\! Calm down. Finn felt his palms get sweaty, and his knees felt heavy. Play it cool, Finn. Remember how she called you stupid.

“W-what is it?” Damn it, his voice cracked.

“I think you already know.” She smiled shyly. “Close your eyes for me?”

Finn was utterly done. With his eyes closed, he heard her soft footsteps inch closer and closer. 

“You know Finn…” She trailed the last letter of his name. 

“I really. Really, really. Hate people like you\!” A sudden sharp feeling poked at his neck, throwing him over backwards. Opening his eyes in shock, Esther was standing there. The dagger she held glinted in the summer night.

What? Why didn’t it pierce his neck?

“Huh?” The boy on the ground said stupidly. “Did you just stab me?” He was touching the spot where I had thrusted. Damn\! I need to kill him right now\!

“Stay away\!” He scrambled to his feet to get away from me, before tripping over his own feet, planting his face in the dirt. I can’t let him get away.\!

With heavy feet, I ran over to him. He had turned over like a turtle, legs sprawling out towards me. “What are you doing\!” He crawled backwards, eventually hitting his back against one of the many trees in the dark forest.

I stood above him, my feet between his squirming legs. I raised my dagger again, I must have just missed the last time, I still wasn’t familiar with this body. Seeing my dagger, as it shined in the dark, Finn raised his arms to protect himself. Idiot, I can just stab it through that opening\! 

“Stop\!”

I stabbed him in the throat. 

“Aaa\!”

I heard him scream, but the soft sensation of flesh was nowhere to be felt. My dagger had bounced off.

I stabbed again

It bounced off again. A golden circle sparkled under the tip of my dagger.

What? 

Finn looked at me with a shocked expression before moving his body. I could see the horizon flip over as I saw a shoe land squarely into my gut. The knife flew across my eyes, shining like a shooting star.

I tried to gather air back into my lungs, only managing to let out small heaves. It hurt. I couldn’t move my body. Why didn’t the dagger go through his throat?

“You’re crazy\!” He stood up. “You’ve gone insane\!”

Don’t say that. I am not insane. I know I’m not.

“What do I do, what do I do?”

I tried to move my body, but it just hurt so much. A rib must have been broken. 

“Dad, I have to wake up dad\!”

The cold grass caressed my face. I had to run. I can’t let Victoria find out-

“You did this to yourself\!”

Something approached and slammed into my head. My mind went blank.

\*\*\*

“Wake up sleepyhead, class’ done already.” 

Where am I? A girl was sitting on my desk as she checked her phone.

“Hellooo? Earth to \*\*\*” A hand appeared in front of me, waving back and forth. 

“Karrie?” What’s she doing here?

“Karrie? Who’s that? I’m Ann, stupid. Your one and only friend. Did you have a silly dream or something?”

I glanced around, it was my old classroom. There were some formulas written on the blackboard, but it seemed like greek to me, literally. 

Ann was wearing our school uniform.

“Whats the date?”

“Wow, gross... Did you read too many stupid books again? Here check it out.”

Turning her phone toward me, I saw the date. It was 20XX.

“That can’t be…”

I could hear the bustling noises of people walking outside our classroom. There were always people talking outside our classroom.

“What do you mean?” Ann placed a pencil on the tip of her nose, balancing it.

“I killed you, you are supposed to be dead.” The pencil snapped in half, each half making a sound as it hit my desk.

“Oh, right”

The classroom shattered, everything disappearing. 

Ann was currently laying in a casket. Countless people had gathered around it, all wearing black. They looked familiar but I couldn't recognize them, all of them had a funeral veil on. The sounds of crying and hiccuping could be heard all over. It was maddening.

“Is this better?” Ann smiled.

Plastered all around were huge flower crests. The fragrant smell coming from them did not help my confusion. The walls of flowers were pressing in on me. I felt my sweat trickle down my back. The wailing people grabbed onto me, dragging me down into the ground. I commanded my legs to run out of here, but they were stuck in the floor as it slowly sank.

Standing atop her own casket, Ann stared down at me. 

“Tell me.”

A pair of brown eyes pierced my own. I didn’t want to look at her.

“Did you really have to kill me?”

She was smiling in the corner of my eye.

\*\*\*  
“You did well my son. Just go back to sleep. Your dad will sort out this misunderstanding."

I couldn’t see.

“It wasn’t a misunderstanding\! She tried to kill me\! Look\!”

My head ached.

“I understand, just go back to your room.”

“But Dad\!”

My hands were tied.

“I won’t say it twice.”

He paused. “What are you going to do”

My legs were tied.

“Go to your room.”

The sound of footsteps getting farther and farther away. A door opened and slammed shut.

“I know you are awake, kid.”

“Where am I?”

“Somewhere secret.” He answered. “Oh I almost forgot.”

The thing covering my eyes vanished. A lamp blinded my eyes struggling to adapt to the brightness. There were a bunch of tools hanging on the wall, hammers, saws and knives. It looked like some carpenter’s workshop.

“So you are Victoria's daughter?” It was the captain of the guards, Finn's father.

“Can you let me go?” I needed to stay calm in these scenarios. 

“Sorry little girl, but I don’t think so.”

“What do you want?” 

“Straight to the point I see.” The corners of his mouth reached his eyes. Calm yourself, don’t waste your energy.

“Ah, ah ah\!” He sang, wagging his finger at me. “Don’t waste your energy, no one has broken free from those knots before\!” He seemed proud.

“Why are you doing this?” I had to buy time, where is the way out?

“Why? Isn’t that obvious?”

“What about your son? What would Finn think?”

He grabbed my head. “How dare you utter his name.”

“It doesn’t matter what he thinks\! He just needs to be safe\!” His face looked just like the paintings of demons the temple liked to hang up. I felt a familiar scent in the dusty air. The rope was digging into my wrists.

“You’re insane.”

“Me? Insane? You tried to kill my son\! You are the insane one here\!” Some of his spit landed on my cheek.

“What did he do to you\!”

What did he do? “It’s personal”

“Hah\! Is that right? Personal.” His face was devoid of emotion.

“Then would it be personal if I paid your mother a visit? What was her name again, Victoria?” He licked his smiling lips, then glared at the air.

“That damn vixen\! Always flaunting herself everywhere she goes\! Who does she think she is\!” He moved his arms erratically around, making them cast long shadows in the room.

“That’s right, I can just pay her a visit. A personal one.” What?

“Don’t…” I mumbled.

He took a step closer. “What was that?”

“Don’t…” He turned his ear toward me, getting closer. “Don’t you dare touch her\!” I slammed into his head with my own, falling over in the process, chair and all. The pain from my broken rib made my adrenaline spike.

“You touch her and I will kill-”

The tip of his boot dug into my gut. “You demon brat\!” I spat out blood.

“That does it, after I’m finished with you”, he yanked my hair, “your pretty little mother is next.”

He set me back up. I had to get out of here, Victoria was in danger. I have to at least tell Gale. Think, there was always a way out-

He pulled out a small box filled with white roses. There were ten of them. He went to one of the walls, taking with him a hammer. He took one of the roses and placed it under my left hand.

“What are you doing?”

He lifted his hammer, positioning it above my left hand.

“Hey wait.”

The hammer ascended higher, above my little finger on my left hand. He was grinning.

“Wait, stop\!”

# Chapter 8: Why

“Honey, wake up”

“Hmm?” I felt my body shake.

“Gale get up.”

“What is it?” Five more minutes…

Smack\! My face got slapped.

“Galen Nikodemus\!”

“Wh-what is it?” 

“I can’t find Esther\!” Victoria seemed about to cry.

“What do you mean, isn’t she in bed?”

“She isn't\!" She was panicking.

I leapt out of bed, running to my daughters room. It was empty.

“Esther\!” Victoria ran around, throwing open the other doors, checking whether she was there or not.

“Victoria”, I called out to her.

“Esther\! Please come out\!”

“Victoria\!” Shaking her by the shoulders, she finally looked at me.

“She’s not here”

“What do you mean?” She stared blankly.

“I can’t sense her with my mana”

Victoria went quiet. Her shoulders fell.

“Can you find her?”

“Don’t worry”, I began packing up my gear, “I will find her no matter what.”

After ensuring that our vicinity was safe, I led Victoria to our neighbors. They were shocked at hearing that Esther was gone. I asked them to look after my wife in case something happened and they ushered her in without thought. They really were a great pair.

I closed my eyes and began focusing my mana whirling in my body. I had occasionally practiced mana control, it was routine by now, but it felt extra hard to control it today. I had to calm my mind. The mana began collecting into my eyes, making them feel warm to the touch. Slowly the world lit up. The faint glow of five mana trails could be seen. Four of them were seeping into the house but a fifth, golden trail could be seen heading toward the town. Esther, where did you go in the middle of the night? 

I began sprinting, the moon at my back.

\*\*\*  
“Stop\!” My little finger was crushed.

“Stop it\!” The hammer had hit the base of my finger.

“Why should I?” The man stared at me. “You tried killing my son\!” He changed out the flower, laying it on the table before me. A fresh flower was put under my bloodied hand. The finger looked disgusting. The outer flesh had been ripped, muscle peeing from underneath. 

“Ahhh\!” The hammer crushed another one of my fingers. Painting another rose.

“No one touches my son without my permission\!”

Why, why why why.

“Shhhh, don’t cry little girl.” He put his hand on my head. “The goddess will welcome you with open arms\!”

The goddess?

“You know that right?” He changed the flowers. There were two red roses staring at me. 

“Huh?”

“Tsk, you still don’t get it.” He raised his hammer again. 

I don’t get it, why was I reincarnated? Why did I get to remember my previous life? I don’t get it.

“I’m doing this for you\!”

My shriek filled the room as my middle finger got crushed. The hammer clattered to the floor. 

“That should be enough for today’s harvest. I can’t send a sweet girl like you all beaten up\!” 

He went to the wall. *I don’t want to get hurt.* He picked up a knife. *I just want to eat tasty food.* He took a step closer. *I just want Victoria to give me another hug.* 

“Mom…” I really don’t want to die again.

“Don’t you worry”, he raised his knife, “you will be able to meet her soon”

I’m sorry mom. I can’t stop crying. I promise I will stop. Please forgive me.

The knife flew towards my neck stabbing into it. I closed my eyes. 

“What?” Something poked my neck and a bright light shone through my eyelids.

A thud hit the ground below my legs. Wrenching my teary eyes open, I saw the knife laying there, the hand still gripping it.

“You bastard\!”

The owner of the hand flew across the room, smashing into the wall of tools. Gale was standing there sword in hand. My dad had arrived.

“You dare touch my daughter\!” The blade flew through the air, slicing off another hand. I couldn’t even see the sword’s shadow.

“My hands\!” He let out a roar.

“Shut your mouth\!” His head flew backwards, a few teeth fell to the ground, upon smashing into my dad’s boot.

“S-shtop\!”

Dad slashed his sword. The left leg got severed.

“W-wait\!”

Another slash, another leg.

“You bastard\! Do you know who I-”

“You goddamn demon\!”

The blade sliced cleanly through his neck sending his head flying. Rolling on the dirty floor, his eyes were still open.

“Esther\!” He turned toward me. Blood had spattered all over his clothes and face. But I didn’t mind.

“Oh my goddess, let me get you out of here.” He began untying my hands and legs.

“Dad…”

“Yes, your dad is here, I’m here.

“It hurts…”

“You’re fine, don’t you worry”. He picked me up into his arms.

“I thought I was going to die…”

“You’re not going to die, I’m here. Shh.”

“I don’t want to die\!” I dug my face into his arms.

\*\*\*  
The incident threw the whole town into chaos. The captain of the guards had died, his body displayed in the middle of town square for all to see, his limbs stacked like bricks on his body. The townspeople started protesting, demanding the capture of the Executioner. The Baron, now without his trusted captain, had to listen to the angry mob, lest he be trampled under their angry feet. A missive had been sent from Barre and resultingly, a bunch of guards from the surrounding towns and cities got sent to our town. It must have cost the Baron a lot.

Dad investigated the secret area and found a field of white roses growing in the dark. I didn’t know what to feel that Finn's father had been The executioner, I didn’t want to feel anything about that matter. 

The newly appointed captain of the guards took the new recruits and did a town-wide search and found the secret area. My dad had erased all traces of us and made it seem like he left town. The guards came to that conclusion and relayed the facts to the townspeople. Seeing the massive number of guards patrolling their streets, they had to reluctantly accept the theory. 

Nothing happened the following weeks and the townspeople began celebrating each week that passed without a murder, it was like a small festival that attracted the neighboring towns and cities. The Baron was beyond happy that more people spent money in his town.

Finn had disappeared somewhere, but I couldn’t care less. Karrie and Eric had a hypothesis that he also got taken by the Executioner, which I couldn’t help but find a bit ironic.

And so two months had passed. The leaves were turning brown and thin summer dresses changed into longer dresses and coats. The skin on my left hand had healed on its own but the damaged fingers could still not fully bend. Scars and disfigured flesh marred my skin where the hammer had hit it. 

My mom was beside herself when she first saw me being carried in by my dad. The physical pain was extreme, but the pain of hearing my moms sobbing through the night hurt me more. She had cried two weeks straight. 

My mom had calmed down considerably, now only hovering around me occasionally. A sad expression crept onto her face each time she saw my hands, which made me want to start wearing gloves. When she heard me tell this, she only got sadder. She made me a comfy pair the very next day.

Sitting with my hands clasped in my lap, I glared at the statue towering over me. What’s so funny, huh? The marble face was smiling at me. 

We were visiting the church today. Dad had asked, or demanded, that the head priest use his healing magic on me. He had a more sizable amount of divine mana and could therefore use a higher grade healing spell. The eternally smiling priest frowned for a second as I felt his magic bounce off my body. It felt unpleasant. 

The sun streamed through the stained glass, blinding me in the eyes. Why was I reincarnated? Was this even a reincarnation? I took over someone’s body and still had my old memories. The monks at the temple said that life was like a wheel, neither a start nor an end existed. Is that why I have my memories? Nothing made sense. I felt my body boil.

My face twisted. And why did my knife bounce off his neck? I wouldn’t have been captured had he just died right there and then. It was perfect, he had been successfully lured to a quiet place. The golden circles seemed to protect him. The same golden circles whenever someone lied. I clenched my hands. It hurt.

“Is this your doing?” My voice echoed in the empty prayer room. Silence.

“Why did you send me here?” The goddess just looked at me, smugly.

“What am I supposed to do\!” I stood up.

“I don’t understand.” I said.

“I don’t understand\!” 

The sun stood behind the statue, making a halo out of its rays, not caring in the least that it was blind me.

“Don’t you look at me like that, wipe that goddamn smile off your face\!”

Her gaze was heavy, I fell to my knees.

“Say something… anything…”

“I didn’t ask to be reincarnated…” The carpet felt itchy under my fists.

“I can’t even kill anyone in this life\!” I banged on the carpeted floor, thumps echoed from it.

“I can’t do this…” Something warm rolled down my face, staining the blood-red carpet. “Tell me what to do…”

“Esther\!” Mom ran over me kneeling in front of the statue.   
“What’s wrong?” She hugged me.

I pressed my face into her arms. “Mom…” 

“What is it sweetie? It’s okay, just tell me”

“I want to go home…”

“Of course, we will go home right away.” Her fingers ran through my hair. 

“My sweet little Esther”

\*\*\*  
Today was my birthday, or more correctly, it was Esther’s birthday. I don’t remember my real birthday. Sugar was hard to come by so mom had splurged a bit and baked me a cake. I had never been gifted a cake before so it tickled my heart. 

Invited to my first ever birthday party and Esther's fourteenth party were: my parents, Karrie’s parents, Karrie, and Eric. We had gotten much closer these past months. The cold had at first seeped through the frosted windows, and the naked trees were covered in fluffy white snow. But today the sun had begun to melt the dazzling snow.

“Congratulations Esther\! May the goddess watch over you\!” Karrie said enthusiastically. Yeah, no thanks.

“What are you gonna wish for?” Eric asked.

“Of course she will ask for money\!” Dad said.

“What are you saying? A growing girl only has one thing to wish for, gems and diamonds\!” Karrie’s father retorted.

“Oh, you’re right\! How hind-sighted of me\!”

Karrie’s mom let out a sigh. “You two…”  

“What are you going to wish for?” My mom asked. 

My wish? I’ve never had a chance to wish for something before, I simply didn’t have the time. The room was cozy and had a joyous atmosphere. Dad and Karri’s dad were busy arguing on what a girl like me wanted to wish for. Sighs could be heard getting louder as they argued their points. Karrie and Eric were busy not trying to puke their food out, they ate too much cake. And my mom, with her gentle blue eyes, was busy looking at me. The whole room smelled of food and cake. It made me happy. I felt my mouth curl.

“My wish…” The room went quiet.

My mouth curled into a big smile. The air, warmed up by their smiles and body, felt refreshing as it touched my teeth. “My wish is to always have days like-”

“Sorry Esther, excuse me for a bit.” Someone had knocked on the door. “Let me go check who it is.” My dad checked the door.

“Raviel? What are you doing here?” It was the lady with the pants and blue hair. She wore a thick dress today. 

“I have come here today as a messenger”

“A messenger?” My dad grasped the letter handed to him.

“I shall take my leave then.” She grabbed the side of her skirt, threw a leg back, and bent her knees. It was a perfect curtsy. “My lord” 

By the time I blinked, Raviel was already in the air, dad had lifted her by the neck with one hand.

“Who sent you?” His murderous aura filled the room, dispelling the previous joyful atmosphere.  

Raviel didn’t seem flustered at all.

“Your father.” She uttered.

The sound of something crashing reverberated through the room, signaling the end of my first birthday party.

# Chapter 9: New City

The steam coming from the cup of tea placed in front of me, flew gently toward the ceiling, eventually disappearing like a dream. Thrown on the dinner table was the letter Raviel had gifted my dad. The pure white piece of paper was crumpled, several creases were visible. Were you to follow those creases like a piece of origami, I would believe it would make a wonderful ball of paper. I glanced at my parents sitting at the table.

My mom gripped her cup of tea, stroking the handle with her thumb. “Do you know why you were called back?” 

“How should I know what my father is thinking?” My dad spat out. My mom’s shoulders shrank into herself, making her silhouette smaller. My fingers hurt as I tried clenching them. This scene was too familiar. My body began to prickle. 

He sighed. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to say it like that”, he said, covering mom’s hands. “It’s just… I really don't know.”

“How did they even find us?” Her hands were turning white as they wrapped around the cup. “Why now?” Glistening beads began to form in the corner of her eyes. She began to tremble. 

My dad stood up and wrapped her into his arms. No one said anything as he stood there, letting his wife crease up his ironed shirt. Wet stains formed where my mother’s face dug into his messed up shirt. The prickling was getting too much.

I went outside.

Taking in the cool winter air, my breath formed a little cloud as I exhaled. I thought happy days would follow me after my birthday party, however the nailing pain in my fingers drove my mind back to reality. The letter was like a curse, bringing with it misfortune. I hadn’t slept well, I hadn’t eaten well, and dad had gotten angrier and more irritable. My mom always hugged me, but it didn’t feel the same, she didn’t smile. 

I tried bending my fingers, only making it send a signal to my brain to stop. I put myself into the house and my parents had reached an agreement. We were to leave this town in four days.

\*\*\*  
“I still can’t believe it…” Karrie’s dad said. “How long are you going to be gone?”

We were currently loading our luggage into a horse-drawn wagon outside our house. My dad had made quick work stacking the boxes.

“I’m betting on being back here after six or seven days, at the latest we should be back by the start of spring.”

“Why are you being so clingy? I’m getting a little jealous." Karrie’s mom said. 

“Hey, what are you saying, woman.” Her husband shot back. 

“My best friend is leaving for the capital, what if he never returns\! Of course I should be clingy\!” He went in front of my dad, shielding him from his wife.

“Argh\! Get out of the way, why can’t you act like this with me\!”

The two of them had been shocked when my parents said that they would leave for the capital in three days. However, they didn’t ask any personal questions, only when we left and when they could expect to see them again. They bantered back and forth as the finalizations were finished. 

“My dear Victoria\!” She held my mom’s hands. “I can’t believe you are leaving me all alone in this town…”

“What are you saying? You still have your husband.” She smiled prettily. “And it’s only for a few weeks at most.”

Karrie’s mom clicked her tongue and feigned a faint, putting the back of her hand on her forehead. “I don’t think I can do it… I’m going to die in these few weeks…” 

My mom let out a laugh. “I promise I will send you letters should it come to that.”

“You better hold onto that promise\!” She said, giving her an enormous hug. 

Karrie had watched our moms hugging. “I don’t think I can do that…” 

“Why not? I like hugs”

She blushed. “It’s embarrassing.”

I had gotten familiar with practically seeing her everyday. We would chat together, take strolls together, and find ourselves in trouble when we occasionally made trouble. It reminded me of the time I spent with Ann. However I knew they were different people. They sometimes did the same things, but the more I talked with Karrie, the more different they appeared. 

I would probably not see her for quite some time. The distance from here to the capital was considerable, even when that shortened with the help of magic teleporting gates. I didn’t even get surprised when I first heard about them, I thought to myself, surprised. 

I threw my arms around Karrie, sharing with her some of my warmth. “Take care, Karrie.” 

“You too, Esther\!” 

Standing there surrounded by the melting snow, our smiles seemed to warm our surroundings.

Their waving arms had disappeared in the horizon as I sat back down in the rocking wagon. My body was getting jostled side to side by the wooden wheels grinding through the frozen ground. Today I learnt I was prone to getting wagon-sick.

I managed to eke out a question on how further we had to drive, to which my father simply smiled at me splayed onto my mother’s lap. We hadn’t even started, he said. I felt my eyes cloud over as my mother combed through my hair.

The Guillain Kingdom had an extensive network of magic gates connecting various cities together, making it easy for people to move around the vast land of the empire. As one might suspect, it cost a considerable sum to use one of these gates. As a result, only the rich were the ones using them. In the letter, demanding my dads return, was an eight-sided token. This was used by nobles to travel around the lands anonymously. Only high-ranking nobles had one of these. Duke Nikodemus must have really wanted his son to visit. 

Thinking about it, doesn’t that make my dad a noble? Would that make me a noble? I did find it weird how excessive dad disliked the Baron, but I never thought more about it. Mom seemed to also sometimes behave in an elegant manner, I liked to copy her when she did that. I wonder what my grandfather will be like. 

“Don’t get your hopes up, Esther. He isn’t the type of person to act like one.”

“What about my grandmother?” I asked. My parents smiled. 

Mom answered my question. “She’s a wonderful woman.” She was smiling like her normal self. “Did you know she saved my life once?” 

I couldn’t help but wonder how such contrasting reactions could come from the mention of my grandparents. I wonder how such a mismatched couple could even conceive a person like my dad. My grandmother must be a really grand woman. 

My parents chatted together as we traveled to the neighboring city where a gate was available. And finally, after a whole day of suffering on the seats of the wagon, we arrived at the entrance to the city.

“This looks good enough.” My dad opened the door to the room we had rented for the day. The magic gate required a half day's worth of time to check our luggage and clear it for transport. Not wanting to arrive earlier than required, my dad suggested resting in this city for a day. I welcomed that thought.

The bed smelled like the sun and I closed my eyes. They were still spinning from the horrid wagon ride. I pressed down the rising feeling in my stomach. Grabbing the pillow, I dug my face in it. That was a mistake. It smelt of lavender. I coiled into myself, letting the pillow fall to the floor.

“Oh, my poor daughter…” She patted my back. 

“I don’t want to ride the wagon anymore…”

My dads next words shattered that hope. “Sorry to say this, but we are still only halfway.”

“Mom…”

“Just rest for now, sweetie. We can go eat some delicious food later\!” I heard her say cheerfully.

*I didn’t want to eat anything*, was what I had previously thought as I stood there in the bakery. The smell of freshly baked bread filled the store, not letting a single visitor escape unscathed. Displayed by the counter stood countless types of pastries, ranging from simple wheat rolls to elegantly designed cakes in all types of colors. It looked just like one of those cafes I had seen in my previous life. 

I shook my pocketbook and heard some coins clink together, ringing out like bells. My parents appeared to be in a joyous mood walking around the city so I asked to go explore on my own, letting them enjoy the day. My dad gave me a whole four silver coins to go have fun. Add to that my first ever silver coin, it totaled to a considerable sum. 

The first silver coin I had gotten was still with me, accompanying me whenever I went out. I had originally wanted to spend it on something or the other but the opportunity never came. The only explanation had to be that it was enchanted by magic. I considered it my lucky charm.

“How much for a slice of that cake?” I pointed to something plain-looking.

“That’ll be five silvers.” The barista-looking woman answered. I half-expected the golden circle to appear, but no matter how long I waited, it didn’t show up.

Five silver coins should be enough to buy enough to buy food for five whole days and still be left with some remaining. Why, our room cost us only three silvers for the day.

I pointed to a bag of cookies. “What about that?”

“That’ll be two silvers.” Something stabbed into my heart.

Pointing to a stupid looking bread roll I asked. “What about-”

“That’ll be three coppers.” The woman was smiling at me.

Standing outside the bakery, I bit into my bread roll. It tasted like bread. I sat disappointed on a nearby bench and watched as the people and carriages passed by. It was one of my new hobbies.

The busy city road was double the width of those in our town and the amount of people busily strutting to and fro must have been four times as many. The sound of the carriage wheels sent shivers down my spine as it rolled along the muddy road.

The pure white color of snow I had gotten used to seeing the past few months was nowhere to be seen. Replacing it was the color brown. Brown roads, brown horses and brown three-coppers costing bread. Something red broke up the monotony as it approached me.

“Eshter?” The red hair called out to me.

“What are you doing here?”

I observed the boy that had left Barre two weeks ago. Karrie and I were a bit shocked when he told us he wanted to become a merchant. Eric’s parents were merchants and he wanted to follow them, learning the family trade. He had grown considerably since the first time I saw him. 

The face had lost some of its boyness, getting a bit sharper and his shoulders looked to be sturdier. A few more years and he would definitely look more than decent. He crossed his arms and smirked at me.

“Did you get lost again?”

I considered throwing the half eaten piece of bread at his stupid face.

# Chapter 10: Eric

I put the rest of the bread roll into my pocketbook. “I’m not lost.”

“That so?” He plopped down beside me. My golden hair fluttered in the air as I bounced off the bench. The wooden planks were bending a bit.

“I heard you will be back by spring?” I nodded. We sat staring in the same direction looking at the other people walking by. 

“Are you here with your mom?” I didn’t see her with him.

“Yeah, we got some extra seeds from Klippel.” He pulled out a round black seed the size of my fingertip. Its outer shell felt rough as it laid limply on my palm, making a scratching sound when I poked it.

“I don’t get why no one buys them.” He pulled out another one and popped it into his mouth, crunching it between his teeth. I could see a few bits of the outer shell fall out of his mouth. It looked and sounded just like eating eggshells. 

“They don’t taste that bad.” He looked serious saying that. 

“What plant is this?”

“Dunno.”

“And you just ate it?” Incredible.

“I was hungry, okay?” He seemed almost offended. “I know what you just thought.”

“You’re imagining things.” 

I kicked my legs as we continued to people-watch. A man and woman were walking with their arms linked together. I wonder what my parents are doing right now.

“I’m bored. Let’s go do something.”

“Do what?”

“No idea, there must be something to do in this city.” He shook his bag of seeds. “Maybe I can find someone to buy these things.” He explained how his mother had assigned him to find someone willing to buy these off their hands. He popped another one into his mouth. 

“You know you are supposed to plant them right?” I remarked.

I glanced through the shop windows while strolling around with Eric. Whenever something weird or strange caught my eyes he would give me a quick and concise answer. His explanations seemed to make it seem more interesting than they really were. A set of ceramic cups could be seen through the window. They were apparently the local product of this city. The cups’ color was unique only to this region as it required a type of clay that could only be harvested around here. They just looked like green tea cups to me.

Eric would give me a long explanation each time I pointed to an object. He seemed to take his apprenticeship seriously as he knew a little about everything. I wondered how much he had studied these past days. I started pointing at whatever caught my eyes.

“Esther”, he looked thirsty, “I think you already know about all these things.”

“I don’t remember what they are.” I stood in front of a display where wares of different colors and shapes were being shaded by the stall. The vendor was busy haggling with the other customers, paying the two of us no mind. 

“You know that you can’t use that line anymore right?”  

“Eric, I really don’t remember, please.” I pointed to an orange object, feeling my mouth twitch as I begged him.

“At least try not to smile while saying that…” He sighed. “These are called carrots, a staple food in our kingdom.”

“Is that so? What about these yellow things?”

“Those are potatoes”

“And these?”

“Onions.”

“Your explanations are quite short, Eric. No one would buy anything from you with that attitude. You make a lousy merchant.”

He gave me a big professional smile. “Thanks, Esther. I will take that advice to heart.”

I skipped around the different shops and stalls all the while dragging along Eric. His shoulders slumped as he dragged his feet after me. That’s weird. I thought he was bored? The roads came to an end, opening up to a square with a clocktower standing in the middle. And below that a crowd had formed. 

The gaggle of people was centered around something. Applause and excited voices could be heard ringing as I tried to get a glimpse of whatever that had them this excited. Standing between two adults, I glanced under their armpits.

Mint green hair reminiscent of the tea cups I had seen blew gently in the air. It looked almost to turn blue against the backdrop of the sky. A pair of soft round eyes, the color of fresh summer leaves, looked flustered as she held the hands of an old woman kneeling before her. She looked like a doe clad in pastel dress as she tried to help the elderly woman off the dirty ground. 

A young man stood behind her, diagonal to the side, with his hands behind his back. He had an impassioned look standing guard behind her, the scabbard hanging on his hip indicating his work.

“Ah, please don’t do this\! Your clothes will get dirty.”

“My clothes getting dirty is nothing in comparison to what you have done for me. I must show you my gratitude\!”

“P-please get up, I didn’t help you to get your gratitude\!” She babbled.

“A simple thanks is enough for me.” An angelic smile formed on the young girl’s face, she looked just like how my mom often looked at me. I could feel the affection flowing from her gaze standing all the way over here.

The old woman broke into tears as she looked up at her.

“Ah, please don’t cry\!” She looked flustered again.

A voice called from the crowd. “She did it again\!”

“I can’t believe she used healing magic on her.”

“She did it for free too.”

“Did it work? I’ve never seen such a bright light before.”

The old woman finally stood up holding a cane in her hand. But the tip didn’t touch the ground, she held it with both her hands. 

Someone in the crowd exclaimed. “I can’t believe it\!”

“Who is she?”

“She’s a goddess\!”

Resounding cheers filled the area we had been gathering in. The old woman lifted her wooden cane high above her head, stretching it into the sky. The stick grabbed our attention as it went higher and higher. I could feel the guard putting his hand above the hilt of his sword, until we all saw it flying downwards at an amazing speed before stopping upon impacting her bent knee. It broke cleanly in half. Silence filled the air.

My mouth went wide as I tried to register in my head what had just happened. The girl seemed to be in the same vein as me standing there cupping her mouth. The young man standing a step behind her simply let out a sigh of relief before turning back into an impassioned statue. The silence broke when the old woman roared. 

“That felt good\!”

The crowd joined her roar and I could hear Eric beside yelling something or the other. 

I saw for the first time how healing magic was supposed to look like as she healed some other people from the crowd. A yellow magic circle formed from her palmed out hands as she focused her breathing. A few seconds later the person being injected let out a really blinding flash of light. It must have felt good as all of them had exclaimed their relief. 

The girl continued to treat the crowd, healing whatever illness or ailment had plagued them. She didn’t seem troubled at all, apart from the people kneeling down in gratitude, as she went through all of them. She simply gave them a gentle smile as her hair shook with the wind.

The crowd had long dispersed and only the two of them remained, she sat on a bench while he watched over her. They were saying something to each other but stopped when they noticed us walking over to them. 

“Oh\!” She clapped her hands. “I saw you two watching from the crowd earlier.” Seeing her up front she looked to be the same age as me, maybe a bit older.

“I’m afraid we are currently taking a break.” The young man said.

“Don’t be like that Leon, I’m really fine.” He simply grunted in reply.

“I’m Esther, I’m currently visiting this city. Oh, and I’m fourteen.” I said my perfect introductory line. The man furrowing his eyebrows didn’t bother me at all. 

“She’s still using that introduction?” I could hear Eric mutter behind me before also introducing himself. It was different from how I said it but it would do. 

The girl let out a chuckle, her sweet voice tickled my ears a bit. “My name is Lavenza, I’m currently traveling with this grumpy boy to see the world.” She gestured to the adult-looking boy. “And I’m sixteen”. Her pure white teeth blinded my eyes as she smiled, making me almost shield my eyes. She must have been a noble as I stared at her elegant sense of air.

“Did you want to ask me something, Esther?”

“Have you traveled to a lot of places?” I asked.

“Oh, more than I can count.”

“Have you seen this seed before?” I decided to help out Eric with his appointment.

She held it in her hand giving it a look. “What seed is this?”

“We don’t know.” Eric answered for me.

“You don’t know?” Leon’s eyes narrowed.

“Yeah, but it’s tasty.” Eric demonstrated for us, crunching the seed shell and all.

“A tasty seed?” Lavenza glanced down at the seed in her fingers.

The boy sighed. “Give it.” He put the round seed he got from her. A crunching sound reverberated in his mouth.

“How is it?” Eric said expectantly. 

“It tastes like raisins.” 

“I know right?\! No one seemed to want to try them. Here, I have lots more\!” He pulled out his bag of seeds.

“I could do without the shell though.” 

Lavenza took another seed from the ecstatic Eric. 

“Oh wow\! It really does taste like raisins.” 

“Esther, now you really have to try one.”

“No thanks, you have some bits stuck in your teeth by the way.”

Eric began poking at his teeth as I told him where to put his finger.

“Ha ha\! You two really make a funny pair.”

“Really?” I couldn’t see the connection.

“Oh I know\!” She said, “Let’s be friends\!”

And so Lavenza and I became friends with the healing girl and her taciturn guard. We chatted while I sat with her while the two boys stood. They seemed to surprisingly vibe well together as Leon began showing off his sword. 

“Lavenza, you seem like a powerful healer.” I asked her. 

“I don’t think I’m that impressive.” She stared in front of her. “I just try my best.”

“Has your healing not worked before?” 

“It hasn't. Why are you asking?” 

I pulled off the glove on my left hand letting it feel the cool air for the first time in a while. Her mouth opened a little and I could see Leon twitch his forehead a little standing there with Eric, he didn’t react. 

It was expected as the flesh squirming around my once-crushed fingers were bulging like waves with circles in its epicenter. My marred hand really looked disgusting as I tried fully bending my fingers. It felt like nails stabbing into it when my bend reached its full potential. I wanted to fix my hand, if not for my mom’s sake. I could still remember how she looked when she saw my disfigured hand for the first time.

“Do you think you can heal my hand? I have three silvers if you want.” It was beyond low for employing a priest or a mage who could heal, still it was all I had right now.

“Don’t you worry Esther.” She held my hand. “I will try my best, no, I *will* do my best\! We’re friends\!”. 

She began focusing and a golden circle appeared over my left hand, the circle looked familiar. And after a while, nothing happened. No bright lights, no nothing. 

“Huh? What’s happening?” I didn’t really get my hopes up.

“Let me try again.” Nevertheless, I felt a bit disappointed as I saw the golden circle appear again. I already knew healing magic didn’t work this body.

“It’s fine, Lavenza.” I quickly put my glove back on. “I expected the outcome.”

“Esther, let me try once-”

“It’s fine.” I stood up from the bench.

“It was fun talking to you two, but it’s getting late, we better take our leave now.” The sun had begun dipping in the sky, making the towering clock tower cast a long  shadow across the ground. 

“Esther, wait-”

“Let’s meet again should the opportunity rise.” I began walking.

Eric was apologizing or something before I heard his brisk footsteps come up behind me. I continued walking while he followed.

“Esther, are you okay?”

“I’m fine.”

“Where are we going?”

“I don’t know.”

“Can you wait for a moment?”

“...”

“Esther, please stop walking.” I felt something grab my hand.

“Let go\!” I yanked my arm back, facing him. It hurt.

“Please talk to me, Esther.” He had a stupid expression plastered on his face.

“What’s wrong?”

“I don’t know\!” I shot back at him. I didn’t know what part of my body that hurt.

“Let’s just calm down, okay?”

“Shut up\!”

I glared at him, glared at his red hair and glared at his TKcolor eyes. Don’t you look at me like that, Eric. 

He took a step toward me. “Breathe, Esther.”

“You’re an idiot\!”

“Yes, I’m an idiot, but you need to breathe, Esther.”

He took another step.

“You’re stupid\!”

“I’m the most stupid person you know, take a deep breath, Esther.”

He put his hand over my eyes, covering them. 

“Just breathe.”

I didn’t want to feel this way

“It hurts…” 

“I know.”

“I was really scared…”

“You’re safe now.”

I stood there while Eric continued to shield my eyes. He didn’t say anything as I felt myself calm down. We must have been standing there for a while.

“*Sniffle*.”

“Have you calmed down?” I could taste something salty sliding down my face as it fell into my mouth.

“*Hic*, Yeah…”

My body shook from the sudden hiccups.

“Can I move my hand now?”

“Not yet…”

It felt calming not being able to see anything.

“I was going to give this to you earlier but so much happened.” I could hear him take something out of his bag.

“I’m gonna move my hand now okay?”

I stayed silent as my eyes took in the bright light outside. A mass of yellow petals bloomed in front of my eyes.

“My mom said they represent strong bonds.”

Yellow alstroemerias.

“Did you get one from Karrie too?”

It smelled disgustingly sweet. I felt my mind go blank.

# Chapter 11: Lavenza

“\*\*\*, you are probably wondering why the Buddha said life is suffering right?”

I was about to put the piece of tofu in my mouth. “No?”

“Well, let me tell you a story.”

There once was a zen master who was praised by his neighbors as a person living a pure life. In his neighborhood was a beautiful girl living with her parents. One day, without any warning, they discovered that she was with child. This made her parents furious. She would not say who the man was, but after much shouting and tears, finally said a name, Hakuin, the zen master. In great anger the parents went to the master. 

“Is that so?” Was all that he would say. 

The girl had a successful birth and the child was brought to Hakuin, by this time he had lost all his reputation, which did not trouble him. But he took very good care of the child, he obtained milk from his neighbours, and everything else the little one needed.

A year later the young mother could not tolerate it any longer. She told her parents the truth, that the real father of the child was a young man working in the fish market. The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask his forgiveness, to apologize at length and to get the child back again. Hakuin was willing. In yielding the child all he said was:

“Is that so?”

The monk finished his story. “Did you understand?”

I picked up a piece of sauteed mushroom. “Not really.”

“Hmm”, the monk hummed. “Is that so?”

\*\*\*  
I woke up laying in bed, did I pass out? Where’s Eric? I looked around and saw that it was the inn we had rented. My mom was sleeping on a chair by the bedside. This situation felt very familiar. Once again, I had made my mom sleep in that uncomfortable position. Sorry.

She opened her eyes as I fumbled around on the bed. 

“Oh, are you okay?” She immediately began fretting over me, she took my temperature with the back of her hand. 

“Good, no fever.” She nodded to herself.

“Mom, I feel fine.”

“Sorry Esther, but I really don’t believe you right now.” She looked concerned. 

“Who knows what would have happened if Eric wasn’t with you? Do you know how shocking it was when we saw him carrying you?” She patted my head. 

“What happened?” 

“Where’s Eric?” I saw my gloves on the nightstand.

“He left saying he had to go with his mother.” I see. “They left yesterday for Barre.”

“Yesterday? What about the magic gate?” I needed to get ready quickly.

“Don’t you worry, we are extending our stay for another night.”

“I’m sorry…”

“Hush, you did nothing wrong.” She held me in her bosom. It felt nice.

“Can you tell me what happened? Eric didn’t say much.”

“What did he say?”

“Just that he was ‘sorry’, did he do something to you?”

“Do you really think Eric would do something?”

“He seems like a good boy.”

“He is.”

I told her what had happened yesterday. How I coincidentally met Eric, how we went around the city and found an interesting pair that we befriended. 

“... I don’t remember what happened afterwards.” I lied to her.

“Really?” She seemed surprised about something.

“What is it?”

“I can’t believe my sweet daughter is already experiencing love\!” She looked exceedingly happy.

“What do you mean?” Love?

“You went on a date with Eric through the city\!”

“It wasn’t a date…”

“Sure it was. It sounded lovely too.”

“Mom, it wasn’t like that.”

“Did you have fun?”

Did I have fun? I thought back on my memories. It had been fun until I, uh… got angry.

“Come here, there’s no need to be embarrassed.” She nuzzled against me.

“Should I tell your father?”

“Mom, it wasn't a date.”

Father had at first also looked concerned when he saw me laying in bed. But mom told him what happened yesterday and he got concerned for another reason. 

“That rascal…”

“Oh hush, he seems like a good boy.” 

“I need to talk with him when we get back.” I need to change the subject.

“What happened to the magic gate?”

“Oh right”, my dad remarked, “we are leaving tomorrow morning. So you just rest for today, I’m grounding you.

“What?” 

“Who knows what would have happened to you if that rascal weren’t with you? We can’t have you sleeping on some boy’s back again. I don’t think I can have that scene happen again…”

“Your father is just worried about your health, sweetie.” Mom said as he scratched his chin.

She pulled out a book. “I bought you a souvenir.” 

“TK The memoirs in the capital”, it was a story written like a diary detailing the most popular spots in the capital. 

“This looks expensive…”

“You are supposed to say thank you.” Dad said.

I smiled. “Thanks mom, I love it\!”

I had read halfway through the book when my mom entered the room. The morning sun was now at its apex.

“Esther, are you expecting guests?”

“I don’t think so?”

“They look like the people you described earlier.”

How did they find me? Luckily my pyjamas had been changed earlier making me look well dressed enough to stroll the streets. Mom had insisted that even when loafing in the room all day, one should still clothe themselves. 

Sitting at a table 

The inn doubled as both a place to sleep and to eat. On the second floor, guests could use the numerous rooms all lined up by the walls. And on the first floor, food could be ordered from the quaint diner. The innkeeper and his wife were the only two working the inn.

“What are you two doing here?” I asked the pair that sat at one of the tables. 

“Oh, what did I tell you, Leon? It was her mother.” Lavenza turned to the boy opposite her seat who just let out a small exhale.

“How did you know?” I could feel my mom peeking from the second floor as I took a seat, joining their table. Lavenza turned to her direction then back at me. 

“You too look exactly the same\!” She chirped happily. “Leon, look again\!”

“Lavenza, you are being rude again.”

“Oh.”

“So what are you two doing here, I don’t think I told you where I was staying at.”

“Eric told us to visit.”

She explained that after carrying me back, he had found the two of them strolling the markets telling them I got sick.

“Are you fine now? You left so abruptly yesterday…” Her eyes looked at the cup in her hands. “It’s my fault isn’t it?”

“What do you mean?”

“You looked fine before I tried to use healing magic. Did you become unwell from that?”

In some sense it did, however the real reason was that my emotions had run rampant. I don’t really understand why I reacted that way, it just did. It didn’t feel good.

“I feel fine now.”

“I knew it. I can’t believe my powers could make someone sick. I’m so sorry, Esther...” She bowed her head.

Shivers went down my spine when I saw the two of them apologize, Leon also had also bent his head. This must be how Lavenza felt when seeing the kneeling people.

“You shouldn’t bow your head that easily”, I said. “Aren’t you a noble?”

Did they really need to look that dumbfounded? “How did you know?”

“It was obvious with your appearance”, I turned to Leon. “You even have a bodyguard protecting you.” 

Nobles never traveled alone, my dad had said. It was to flaunt to the commoners that they were worth more. My mother argued back that they had to travel in a group because there were many angry and dangerous people willing to do anything, especially to noblewomen. My mom looked uncharacteristically angry when she told him that, to which my dad had to reluctantly accept defeat.

Lavenza looked flustered and Leon just sighed.

“It hasn’t even been that long before I got caught…”

“Do I have to call you Lady Lavenza now?” It rolled off nicely off the tongue.

“Ah\! Don’t even think about it\! Just call me like you usually do.”

“Yes, my lady.” I couldn’t help but chuckle seeing her blushing face.

“You’re surprisingly nonchalant about this, Esther”, Leon said. “Commoners are typically afraid to talk to nobles.”

“The noble ruling our town happens to be a decent person. You can often spot him in town talking to the townspeople.”

“Really? That’s unusual…”, Lavenza added. 

“Oh, that’s right. My father is also a noble.” The two of them looked stunned. Nice I even managed to get Leon.

“Which makes me a noble too. I think.” 

Lavenza was about to open her mouth when the door to the inn creaked open. It was my dad.

“Are you out and walking about, Esther?” He walked up to our table. “You must be my daughter’s new friends, please take good care of her.” A handsome smile appeared in front of us. I didn’t really notice this but he was rather tall, standing half a head higher than even the tall Leon. His forearm muscles bulged, showing off well-defined veins as he held a bag. It looked heavy.

They turned to me, unsure what to say in this situation. I just put my finger in front of my mouth.

“A-ah, yes\! We will make sure to do that.” Her voice pitched weirdly.

“Of course”, Leon took a pause in his sentence, “sir.”

“Haha, you befriended some energetic kids again.” He patted my head. “Well, let me make myself scarce, you guys have fun.” The stairs creaked under the combined weight of my dad and his bag full of stuff. 

Silence filled the room where only the three of us used. The other guests had already started their day or were sleeping in. 

“What\!?” Lavenza exclaimed. “You’re a noble too?”

“My father is a noble. I found out about a week ago.”

“So the reason you are visiting the capital is…”

“Yup, we're going to visit my grandfather.”

“Sounds complicated…” Lavenza threw herself over the table. “It’s not easy being a noble. I just want to have fun and travel”, she babbled.

“Interesting”, Leon said, “Is Eric a noble too?”

“Not everyone from our town is secretly a noble, you know?”

“Funny hearing that from you.”

Lavenza pulled herself back up. “Do we have to call you Lady Esther now too?”

“That sounds nice, I would prefer that.”

“I would rather not…”

“You can call me whatever you want, Lady Lavenza.”

“Stop calling me that\!”

The two of them had initially wanted to just check up on me, however it had gotten pretty late when we finally found pause in our chatting. My mom suggested we eat together, she wanted to thank the guests for entertaining my day.

The diner was now filled up with dozens of people making the air in here a bit stifled but warm. It felt cozy in the late winter temperature. Mrs. Innkeeper was busily going to and fro deftly weaving between the tables and customers alike, in her hands dozens of dishes were stacked as she swooped up the empty plates and placed new ones in one motion. The steam coming from the dishes cooked by Mr. Innkeeper smelt delicious. 

“So you got grounded?” Lavenza asked while neatly spooning some steaming soup. Leon, sitting beside her, grabbed some bread with his hands and chomped on it, letting out a crispy crunching sound.

My mom told them that I was often feeling unwell and had to rest adequately. I had to spare some energy for the trip tomorrow.

“Wow, a magic gate. You should look forward to it, it's pretty amazing\!”

“You have used one before?” My dad asked.

“O-oh, I read about it in a book\!”

“A book huh? Did you learn to read at the church?”

“The church?”

“You have healing powers right?” Mom answered instead. “Thank you for using it on our daughter, I don't know how to repay you.”

“It was nothing\! Besides, it didn't work…”

“I see”, dad remarked. “She must have shown you two. Thank you for still accepting her.” My dad looked sad.

“She’s been a good friend to us”, Leon said, nodding his head.

“Ho ho, you two really are respectful. Are you perhaps-”

My mom smacked my fathers arm, sending him a silent stare before turning to them.

“You two must still be hungry, here have some more, doesn’t it taste better the more people there are?”

“It really does\!” Lavenza nodded enthusiastically.

With the plates wiped clean and ample time had passed, Lavenza and Leon took their leave. She promised to say hello the next time we met and gave me her handkerchief. It felt soft beneath my gloves and a crest was embroidered in the corner. I wondered what house she came from as I waved back at her shrinking image. Leon didn’t even look back once.

It was finally time as I checked my pocketbook. Money, check. Lucky charm, check. Seeds from Eric, check. Half-eaten piece of bread, check. I threw that piece of bread as far as I could between the trees. Now I had to turn my pocketbook upside down to get all the stupid crumbs out.

We stood in line waiting our turn to use the magic gate. I could hear it wobble as the surface of the building sized mirror warbled. It looked like the surface of a lake if something constantly disturbed it. 

“Name?” One of the magicians asked.

“Gale.”

“Last name?”

My dad went up to him and showed the token he had received from Raviel. It ensured anonymity and was only used by a select few high-ranking nobles.

“R-right this way, sir\!”

“Want to hold my hand, Esther?” Mom reached out her hand which I accepted.

“It should feel like taking a swim, no need to be worried.”

“But dad”, I said. 

“I’ve never taken a swim before.”

“Oh right.”

I felt something push me as my body fell forwards into the shimmering surface.

“See you on the other side\!” I heard my dad say.

# Chapter 12: The estate

Countless people streamed across the narrow sidewalks as the sun peeked between the tall buildings, casting a cool shadow across the double-wide road. The road was laid with cobblestones, making the carriages rattle as they passed each other by. I could feel my back being stroked as I forced myself to describe more things I saw out of the carriage.

My father sat on our side crossing his arms. “At least you had the forethought to send a carriage without a family crest.”

“Of course, I personally witnessed your temperament last time.” Raviel sat opposite of us, her back against the driver’s seat. The seats may be a little small for two adults and sitting together, yet this was the best configuration we decided.

Duke Nikodemus, my grandfather, had sent Raviel to pick us up at the magic gate station. Her hair had grown a bit longer, it now reached to her shoulders. She had exchanged her usual bow and pants for a simple but elegant dress. TKdressdescription. It flowed softly downwards only stopping once it reached her ankles. Hadn’t it been for the colors, I would have thought she wore one of those maid outfits.

No one said anything in the carriage, only sounds of the wooden wheels hitting the cobblestone entertained our whole way to our destination. We were going to finally meet the patriarch, Gregor Nikodemus. My mothers hand trembled as she continued to stroke my back. 

We crossed a large gate where a guard confirmed Raviel’s identity, giving her a little bow. Behind the gate stood a paved path sandwiched by two large swathes of bushes and trees. A gazebo could be seen on the right side.

The rows of bushes converged together letting the Estate stand centerpoint, it looked magnificent, several times bigger than our inn we had lodged at for two days. A friendly looking gentleman was waiting on the stairs for us with several other maids and servants lined up behind him. They went immediately to work upon our arrival, unloading our luggage.

My father opened the carriage door, letting the refreshing air in much to my delight, before stepping confidently out. My mother followed suit as she used my dads  outstretched hand as a balance point while stepping gracefully down. It was a little surprising how natural she looked being escorted by my dad. Then it was my turn. My father grabbed me by the sides and lifted me down with a childlike plop. Wow.

“Welcome back Young Master Galen.” The butler said, crow’s feet forming at the corners.

“I’m not that young anymore, Alden.” 

“I see you too are in good health, Lady Victoria”

“It has been a while, sir Alden.” She gave a pretty curtsy.

“You must be the young miss.” 

I mirrored the curtsy my mom had done. “Hello, my name is Esther. I’m fourteen.”

“Goodness, has it really been that long?” He bent his knee making me look down at him slightly. “Welcome to the Nikodemus Estate”, his smile was bright. “Our most treasured possession.”

We were being led down a long carpeted hall by the butler, it felt weird walking on something so soft and squishy. 

“It’s a shame that Master TKgale’sbrothername and Miss TKgale’ssister isnt here to keep you company.”

“Alden.” My father stopped walking. “I’m only here for one purpose, just take me to my father.”

“Of course my lord, my age must be showing. Here, this door.”

“Still using the same room I see.” My dad was about to open when the butler stopped him.

“I must ask that only you meet with His Grace.” 

“And why is that?” My father squinted at him.

“His Grace asked for your understanding.”

“That’s rich coming from him.”

My mom spoke up. “It sounds important, dear, you should listen to him. Sir Alden, can you find us a place to rest?”

“Of course my Lady, please follow me.”

I followed my mom as we left dad for himself. The door seemed to swallow him as he went inside. 

“Thank you for convincing him” The butler did a little bow as he opened the door to another room. 

“I didn’t do it for you.” The room looked to be a guestroom, it was huge. 

“I just want to get out here as fast as possible.” She closed the door behind her.   

\*\*\*  
Galen went into the room and saw his father sitting at the same couch he always sat on. A bunch of documents lay spread over the low-raised tea table. Hearing the door to his office open and close, he put down the document in his hand. 

“You are late.”

“Good to see you too, your grace”. Galen stood in front of the tea table hands behind his back. He looked down at his father, he had gotten older, gray hairs could be seen here and there. 

“Why did you call for me?”

“You were supposed to arrive last week.” Was it that important whether he was late or not? He hadn’t seen his son in years and the first thing he said upon meeting him was, “You are late”, seriously? Gale couldn’t help but lose his cool. 

“I will take my leave if you don’t tell-” 

“Your mother is dying.” 

The words coming from his father were unexpected, it didn’t even register in his head. 

“What?”

Sure, he didn’t ask about the whereabouts of his mother or how she was doing, but he chalked it up to being busy. She should still be healthy at her age. He had planned to introduce his beautiful daughter to her before leaving again.

“She doesn’t have many days left.” Galen could hear his father’s voice tremble a little.

“The priest had said a month.” It was the first time he saw his father’s figure look like this. His father, one of the most powerful men in the empire, one of the most strict fathers he knew of, and one who never showed much emotion, had a sad expression on his face. His father looked small, sitting there on his worn out couch.

“It must now be three weeks left since you are finally here.” But he couldn’t feel his anger rise inside of him. He wouldn’t have delayed the trip to the capital this much if he had known. He had wasted away a week of his mothers life. All because the stupid letter didn’t say why he was called back.

“Why didn’t you say that in the letter?” Galen practically growled.

“Take a seat, we have much to go through.” The aging man simply straightened out the documents on the table. They were thick with ink.

“I would have come as fast as I could if you had just written that\!”

Gregor slammed his fist on the table. “Take. A. Seat.”

“How am I to look at some damned piece of papers right now\! What even are these?\!” He picked up the nearest document on the table. “Is this her inheritance?\!” Galen’s voice got louder for each new sentence he said.

But the next words from his father trumped even that, booming in the room, even penetrating out into the hall and the neighboring rooms. 

“Yes they are\!\!” Gregor Nikodemus stood up. 

“Laying dying in her bed\! Wrote this piece of paper\! Giving all her everything to you\!”

He was screaming into the face of his son, his youngest son, his son that had forsaken his name. Galen couldn’t do naught but looked shocked at his father grabbing him by his collar. He looked down at the man that had raised him, he looked down. His father had gotten smaller in the time he was gone.

“To her most ungrateful\! And insane child\!”

\*\*\*  
It was delicious, I had to take another piece. A maid had come in with some tea and refreshments. A plate of cookies looking like small checkerboards sat in front of me. I had missed this sweet taste.

My mom was staring at me as I stuffed another one in my mouth. “Is it good?”

I couldn’t answer with my mouth full so I opted to nod instead.

“Maybe I should call for another plate.”

“Really?” My mom seemed to sparkle more than usual today.

“Of course\! Your mother used to live here a long time ago, you know?”

“Why did you leave?” It had been bothering me for a while.

“Oh…”, she seemed to find an answer. “How about we tell you when we get home again?”

“You don’t need to tell me if you don’t want to.”

“You’re not curious?”

“You and dad seem to get sad whenever you talk about it. I don’t need to know.”

She smiled. “My sweet and lovely daughter, I pray that you are always happy and healthy\!” She went up and gave me a hug. I could see some crumbs falling onto her dress as she nuzzled up against me.

A new plate of cookies had been delivered. The maid gave me a gentle smile as she bowed herself out of the room with the polished ceramic plate on her cart. It tasted a bit different, earthy with bits of sweetness. I observed the cookie in my hand, flat on the bottom and dome shaped. It looked rustic with the visible pieces of grain sticking out of it with black colored dots adding a bit of color. I didn’t like raisins but who knows when I would eat something sweet for free ever again? 

“Are we leaving after dad has finished talking?” I munched on the last cookie.

“If all goes well.” My mother was sipping her second cup of tea. The tea cup seemed different and hard to hold, ours at home looked more like mugs. She held it gracefully, letting her pinky point outwards.

“Will I be able to meet my grandfather?”

“You should call him His Grace when referring to him.” My mom taught me a lot of noble etiquette while traveling. It was interesting, but I sometimes forgot in the moment. 

“Although I don’t think your father wants you to meet with him.” 

“Does he hate His Grace?”

She put down her cup with a soft clink. “It’s hard to say.”

“What about Her Grace, can I meet her?”

“That should be doable, I actually want to meet her again too\!” Mom must really like my grandmother to smile like that.

“Let’s ask your father after he is done talking.”

It’s a shame that our rooms had a room in between us, making it impossible to hear what they were talking about. Must be to protect against eavesdroppers. I couldn’t help but click my tongue in my head.

The door opened and my dad took a step in. My mother quickly got up and held his face in her hands. He didn’t look well. I felt my stomach drop.

“Gale, what happened? What did you talk about?”

“Victoria…” He sounded hoarse.

“Yes I’m here.” He laid his head on her shoulder.

“My mother is dying…” The room was silent.

“She has three weeks left.”

“That can’t be…” My mother’s voice trembled. I felt my throat squeeze up.

“We have to stay here until…”

Why was this always happening?

“...until my mother passes away.”

“No…” My mom lost the strength in her legs. It was like a pull-string doll that used all of its rope. 

“I’m sorry.”

Why couldn’t we just be happy? Why must I always feel this way? In this life and my previous life. 

I watched as my father carried my crying mother to the couch. I couldn’t help but do the same as I stood there feeling something wet roll down my face.

# Chapter 13

“This is your room Miss, do you have any questions?”

The room was as large as our house in Barre. It had a big bed, a big closet and a big vanity desk. Reflected on the mirror of the vanity desk was me. Long blond hair and puffy blue eyes. I had gotten used to seeing this face whenever something shiny reflected it, however today it looked completely bizarre. 

Outside the big window situated on the third floor was the garden. A green color had begun taking over the place and I saw some flowers looking up at me from the square and circle bushes. I closed the curtains.

“Everything in here is mine?” 

“That’s right.”

“How did that happen?” There wasn’t a speck of dust on my finger.

“His Grace wanted Miss’ and Miss’ family to have a comfortable stay.”

“I see.” The air was cold in this huge room.

“Can you remove these flowers for me?”

The maid that had been assigned to guide me paused for a second, she looked to be in her twenties. 

“Of course Miss.” The flowers on the circular table in the middle got swiftly removed, vase and all.

“Thank you, that’ll be all.” She excused herself and left me alone in the huge room.

Sunlight tried to pry itself through the windows. Drawing all the curtains made it dim. At least the bed felt comfortable enough, my body sank downwards making the soft duvet squish me. My parents had a room on the left wing of the Estate while mine were on the right. I wonder how my mom is doing. Maybe I could try to cheer her up. I willed my body to move, but it was futile. My body didn’t move an inch, it merely stayed still.

Spread in front of me were several knives, forks and spoons. They glistened as the embroidery caught the light from the chandelier. The maids and servants began laying out the food. At the head of the table sat my grandfather, Duke Nikodemus. To his right sat my dad and mom, with the former sitting closer. I sat opposite of mom, making the seat between His Grace and I empty.

Noble etiquette for dining was surprisingly simple. You start with the utensils on the outside and work yourself in, make sure to not make too much noise. I picked up the next pair of utensils and began cutting the venison steak. The food was unfortunately really delicious.  

“She eats like she has never eaten before. Are you even feeding her?”

“She eats plenty, we’re just tired from the trip.”

His Grace gave out a “hmph” and called for a servant standing at attention. 

“Give this to her.” It was another plate of venison. 

“You don’t have to eat it, Esther.” Dad said.

“Thank you, Your Grace.” I bowed my head. 

“I wonder who she takes after.” A shrilling sound could be heard coming from my father's plate. 

“And what’s up with that glove of hers.” My father put down his knife and fork. Mom just looked at me with a sad expression.

\*\*\*  
My first impression of my grandfather left me a little conflicted. I wanted to explore the estate after waking up from my nap. Strolling around and looking at the paintings was pretty fun. There was a particular painting that caught my attention. It depicted a grotesque figure lifting a person and eating them. Instead of a face of pleasure being painted on the figure, a look of horror and disgust stared back at me instead. 

“An interesting painting isn’t it?” The sudden question made my shoulders give a quick jump. It was the Duke speaking beside me.

“A personal friend of mine painted this.”

“Are there other paintings here made by them?” I wanted to see more.

“No, this is the only one he left with me.”

I looked at him. He was neatly dressed in a suit standing with a straight posture. It was hard to read his face as he stared at the painting, neither smiling nor frowning. His TKsamecolorasgales eyes were calm like the mountains I saw on the way here. The combined features really made one feel intimidated in his presence.

The timing to give my introduction or greet him had already passed. A peculiar atmosphere surrounded us as I held my silence, he must already know who I am.   
I thought no more of it and continued admiring the painting. The way the figure looked evoked an emotion from me. I finally figured out why the temple had the paintings of the demons hung up. It was a painting of yourself.

“Why do you think I had this painting hung up in the main hallway?”

“As a reminder, Your Grace”. He paused.

“I haven’t heard that answer before.”

He pulled something out of his pocket and gave it to me. It was my reward for entertaining him. Unwrapping the paper revealed a piece of candy. He left before I could say anything. It tasted like lemon, bittersweet.

\*\*\*  
The servants began taking our plates away, serving us after dinner tea. I’ve never had so much sugar in one day before. After the main dish, venison, was served, the desserts began rolling out. It was my favorite part of this meal. My stomach was filled to the brim. Mom looked happily at me seeing me wipe each and every plate given to me, she herself had only eaten about half of each, even the desserts.

“Where are my brother and sister?” 

“They are out managing their own territories.”

“I already sent out a letter telling them to come.” I sipped the hot tea.

“Were going to visit your mother tomorrow, so go buy yourselves some proper clothing.”

My grandmother wasn’t staying at the family Estate but at one of the church-TKsomethingwithrecuperating. It was one of the most advanced facilities in the empire employing only the best priests and healing mages. The only problem being that she felt lonely as the priests needed to precisely control all variables. There was no point in doing so anymore. 

A seamstress took my dimensions as I spun around and lifted my arms up and down. She flitted happily around and discussed my dresses with her assistant. 

“Golden hair and azure eyes, I think this design fits the best.” She held a design for a dress in her hand. TKdressDescription the skirt bloomed outwards stopping a bit below the knees. It was intended for young ladies like me. It looked pretty.

“Or wait\! What about this one?” She held another design. TKanotherdressDescription, this one stopped at the ankles. It also looked pretty.

“Assistant\! What should we do? Everything fits the young miss\!” They discussed noisily as I posed for them.

“Which one do you like, sweetie?” My mom had already chosen a pair of designs, she said she picked the ones she used to wear. Maybe I could pick something similar to hers.

“I think this one would look cute on you\!” She picked the one with the knee-length skirt and ribbons. 

“Ah\! Lady Victoria\!” The seamstress yelled.

“W-what is it?”

“That's right\! How could we forget\! Assistant, pick out all the cutest ones\!”

\*\*\*  
My new dress bounced up and down whenever the carriage rattled on the road. This one was ten times better than the other carriages as it had some kind of suspension system. It was fancy too, even bearing the Nikodemus family crest.

I kicked my legs back and forth watching the dress ripple softly. The seamstress also gave me a pair of new gloves which fit snugly like a glove, or a like the stockings I wore. My mom sat beside my dad who had his arms crossed. I sat with His Grace, who also had his arms crossed. Once again, our carriage ride rolled to its destination, only the sound of the slightly less rattling wheels could be heard.

We arrived at the facility that looked like a big church. The brick walls stood menacingly and with the combined height of the spiked roofs, made it towering above us. The main tower seemed to want to pierce the sky.

“Thank you for greeting us with your presence, Your Grace.” A priest had welcomed us into the facility. 

“It’s no problem, keep up the important work.”

“Her Grace is currently resting in the courtyard, please allow me to guide you.”

The facility looked exactly like a church, the only difference being there was no altar or a statue of the goddess. I felt my mouth smile.

The courtyard was even bigger than the one at the estate, it looked like a small forest, where all the trees and plants had been personally cultivated by numerous talented gardeners. I spotted an elderly looking woman sitting on a bench basking in the sunlight with a blanket over her legs.

My grandfather said something first upon spotting his wife. “Rosalyn.” He smiled gently as he called out to his wife.

“Oh, is that you, Gregor?” She held her husband's hand.

“What brings you here?” Her eyes looked at his voice with gray dreamlike eyes.

“I took that brat with me.” 

“Galen is here?” She opened her eyes wider.

“Hello mother, I’ve come to visit.”

“Oh my goddess\! Galen, it’s really you\!” My father had let her feel his face. 

“It has been so long…” I had to squint upon seeing her smile. 

“Welcome back, my son”. She patted my father’s hand as she smiled brightly. 

“Did you bring Victoria with you?”

“I’m here, Your Grace.”

“My, how thin your hands have gotten, are you eating properly?”

“Of course, these days have been a bit hectic is all.”

“You should take better care of yourself, you're still young.”

“I could say the same about Your Grace.” Mom’s smile looked like grandmother’s.  
   
“All these years and you still try to flatter me.” They gave out a chuckle together.

“How old is your daughter now?”

“You could ask her yourself”, she said cheeringly.

“You mean?”

My mom pulled me forward. “Hello, my name is Esther, I’m fourteen. Your Grace.” I tried to say grandmother.

“What a sweet voice, can you come closer?” I stared at her black hair. 

“You won’t mind this old wrinkly woman feel your face will you?” I stared at her crow’s feet.

“My\! You look just like Victoria\!” I stared at the mole under her eye. 

“Hello, Esther. My name is Rosalyn Nikodemus.” I stared at her dimples.

“But I would prefer it if you would call me grandmother.” I had seen her before. 

Karrie had been the only person I recognized from my previous life. A coincidence, I convinced myself, it didn’t make sense otherwise. Yet here was another case. She sat there smiling, not even noticing that my eyes were stabbing into her. 

I had killed this woman before.

# Chapter 14: duchess

The tower of cookies and cakes cast a shadow across my empty porcelain plate. They were stacked on top of another, making it easy for one to reach over and serve themselves. My mother and grandmother sipped on their tea as they chatted in the gazebo, shading them from the midday sun. 

“It’s been a while since I’ve had a tea party, how joyous.”

“Likewise, Your Grace.”

“How long are you going to keep calling me that? I already gave you permission long ago.” 

My mom paused for a second. “Then, let me call you Lady Rosalyn”

“Hmm, that works too.” She sipped her cup.

Father had left with the Duke to go fix some paperwork, making us three the only ones left. It was surreal. My mom and grandmother, who had the same face as one of my victims, were talking with each other. Her familiar tone of voice made my stomach churn. It rang out with clear intonation as it grazed my ears. It was hard to listen to. The mention of my name made my shoulders flinch.

“Have you planned her debut yet?”

Debut? I heard my mother talk about that once. It was a party of some sort, the intention being to introduce children of a suitable age to society. Debuts in all forms and sizes were hosted all across the kingdom but the most important one was the royal ball. It was there noble children would formally make their appearance and start contributing to their noble house.

“So much has happened that we haven’t had the chance to think about it…”

“Is that so?”

“Besides, debuts aren’t that common for people like us.”

“What a shame it is. I had liked to see her attend the royal ball next year.”

“Your Grace…”

“Why do you sound so sorrowful? Just seeing you three doing so well fills my heart.” Her hand slid across the table surface before finding her cup. She took a sip. 

“Has Galen told you about my proposition?”

My mom slumped her shoulders. “He has.”

“And your answer?”

“Lady Rosalyn, I’m currently living a happy life together with my husband and sweet daughter. Just having them by my side is enough for me.” 

“I see, it must have been too presumptuous of me. It was intended to be my apology, yet I forgot the most important thing.” She straightened out her posture.

“As a Duchess of the Guillain Kingdom, I, Rosalyn Nikodemus, want to formally apologize to you.” She bowed her head, nearly touching the table.

“I am sorry.”

“Your Grace\! You shouldn’t bow your head to someone like me\!” The chair nearly fell as she stood up. 

“Why can’t I apologize to my daughter?”

“Rosalyn…”

“Victoria, you are and will always be one of my precious daughters. Even if we don’t share the same surname, I want you to remember that.” 

She still had her head bowed. “Would you accept this selfish dying woman's apology?”

“Of course\! Please lift your head\!”

She smiled gently

She softened her eyes. “All these years and you are still the same. Thank you dear, my heart feels lighter now.” It dazzled, a golden circle had appeared. 

“I’m happy to hear that, but there’s nothing to apologize for. You didn’t do anything to me.”

“Exactly. I did nothing.” She turned her gaze downwards.

My mom opened her mouth a few times but in the end, nothing was said. Our tea had cooled down, no longer requiring us to blow on it. The only sound I could hear were the rustling trees as the wind shook the leaves. My plate was still empty.

“Would you grant a wish of mine?” My grandmother broke the silence.

“Of course, what is it?”

“Could you ask if Esther would want to have occasional tea parties with me?” 

“Tea parties?”

“You may be too busy to humor me at the estate and I want to get to know my last granddaughter.” 

My mom turned towards me, an expectant look on her face. I didn’t have any real reason to turn down her wish, nonetheless, her gaze staring at me made my eyes flinch. She was staring straight into my eyes. How did she know where my eyes were? 

“It would be an honor, Your Grace.”

“My\! Listen to her talk, did you teach her?”

My mom giggled. “We had ample time on our way to the capital.”

The atmosphere in the estate had gotten livelier, back when we first arrived the servants and maids had a quiet disposition. They talked to each other in a low tone, and their feet shuffled quietly across the floor, as if they had been ordered to not make a sound. Now that the Lady of the house was back at her rightful place, everything turned upside down. 

Light footsteps were heard in the halls, the same with talking and gossip. It was confusing, no one acted as if the Duchess had a month at best of her life. Even the Duchess didn’t act like it as she went around being led by her personal maid greeting everyone. She looked healthy to me. The diagnosis must have been bogus, I thought while walking on the fluffy carpet. My grandmother had invited me to tea today. 

My face muscles were starting to get sore as all the maids I passed smiled at me. We were guests of honor invited by the Duke himself and they had to act appropriately, but this was too much. Luckily I didn’t need to pull my mouth into a smile in front of the Duchess. She couldn’t see afterall. The maid opened the door for me and announced my presence. A leg behind and grab the sides of your skirt. “Good afternoon, Your Grace.” I gave her a curtsy.

“Your manner of speaking astounds me, Esther. How was her curtsy, Alice?” She asked her personal maid.

“It was very elegant, Your Grace. It looked just like young lady Estelle.”

The Duchess’ room was twice the size of mine on the third floor. All the small bits and bobs were nowhere to be seen, making it look rather frugal. Light from the windows lit up the room and the tea table my grandmother was sitting at. 

“Alice, why don’t you show our guest to her seat?”

It was my first time being escorted. My lips curled, I felt like an important person. The cookies in front of me looked freshly baked, still giving off wisps of steam as it. But how should I eat this? There was no knife nor fork to use. 

“We typically use our hands when eating these kinds of desserts.” She picked up a cookie.

I tilted my head. It didn’t feel right to use my fingers, I had gotten used to the feel of utensils. The Duchess was munching on the cookie, not a single crumb fell from her mouth. My right glove laid limply on my lap while my now gloveless hand picked the biggest cookie from the pile. Freshly cooked cookies were now my favorite I decided, after feeling its chewiness between my teeth.

“How is it?”

“It’s really tasty, Your Grace.”

“You can call me grandmother when it’s only us talking.” Her eyes smiled.

Grandmother? That would be difficult. How could I call the woman with that face grandmother? It was fine calling Karrie a friend, because she was. However… I looked to her personal maid for help and she just nodded. 

“Grandmother, may I ask a question?” She wiped her mouth with a napkin. 

“What is it, dear?” Her answer made my body shiver.

“When was the last time you saw me?” 

“Yes, you may not remember, it was a long time ago.” It was the real Esther, not me. “You became fourteen this year? Then it must have been seven years ago when I first saw you.”

My father had appeared in front of the Duke while clutching his ill daughter. It was the first time the Duke saw this unknown granddaughter of his and he went mad. My grandmother said she could still vividly remember how my father begged on his knees while the Duke roared at his son. No other priests could cure Esther, his only hope was the high priest employed for the personal use of house Nikodemus. It worked. Esther had lived until she was thirteen until I took over. 

“It may be better if you don’t remember that memory”, she said.

“Then I will do that”

“I didn’t see the resemblance in the chaos of the situation, but you really do look like Victoria.” It was weird how she kept using phrases involving her eyes. 

“Can you secretly see, grandmother?” She laughed.

“Oh, it’s just a habit of mine, how silly I must seem to be. I lost all vision in my eyes a year ago”, she said. “Now I see nothing even when I open my eyes.” I stared at the golden circle that appeared in front of my face. Wait, she’s not blind? 

Her familiar face had shocked me once already but the appearance of the golden circle really sent me over the edge. Luckily Alice had her face hidden as she served more sweets and tea. I had to close my mouth fast. Wait, didn’t that mean she saw everything? The Duchess was smiling.

My mouth muscles ached as we continued our talk. She told me how my grandfather, the Duke, had always been a stoic man. He had too much responsibility as a subject of the kingdom, but he always meant well, she said. I couldn’t agree. My mom had been constantly spaced off in the air or cried in her sleep. A key lime pie crumbled in my mouth as I watched my grandmother regale her stories. It tasted bittersweet.

The tea party ended and I went to explore more of the estate. The paintings last time were interesting to look at, maybe I should find more of them. A young maid roamed the halls, busily dusting the wall mounted lamps. 

She poked her cheek with a finger. “Paintings? Maybe the portrait room? Do you want me to show you the way?” 

And so I followed her as she led me to a room full of portraits. Most of them were covered with a white cloth but the ones starting from the current Duke could be seen. It immediately stuck out to me how my father’s portrait was nowhere to be seen. 

The portraits showed the current living members of the Nikodemus family. The duke had three children, including my father. They all had black hair. My uncle had two children and my aunt also had two. They too, had black hair. 

I had been proud of my golden hair, it was pretty and it looked like mom’s. But at this moment, seeing all of the portraits have jet-black hair, I felt bitter. Was my hair color why father and mother didn’t want to come here? There was a faint outline on the wall, it was where my father’s portrait should have been.

# Chapter 15

This morning, the servants were busy with preparing for the arrival of the Duke’s children. I was learning some more noble etiquette from my mom when I asked her how to act and behave in front of them. She told me to not worry. They won’t even look or talk to us. Mom’s comment didn’t exactly make me understand but seeing them walk with a noble air around, I understood. These were real, proud and confident nobles.  
   
Although I had learnt how to act like a noble by observing my parents and my grandparents, there was something different about them. They marched in the entrance with a confident gait while the servants took care of their luggage. The first first family to arrive was my uncle. A carriage bearing the family crest, a rose, was stationed out in the driveway. Different from the Nikodemus crest was the color. Instead of the usual black, it was blue instead. There was a blue rose painted on the carriage.  
   
My uncle had a friendly appearance. The end of his eyes drooped downwards to the sides, making him appear to always be smiling about something. His wife looked dazzling, literally. A necklace with countless gems fitted into it, earrings that seemed far too big and I could swear I saw diamonds sewed onto her dress. It was sparkling whenever she took a step. Imagine how many silvers her outfit would cost. 

The next to arrive was my aunt. Her carriage sported a green rose this time. Why was the family crest a rose of all things, couldn’t there be an animal or a sword at least? I could already feel my irritation brew as a striking woman entered through the door. She was a fox. At the temple there were some foxes living in the surrounding forest. They had an air of mystique about them, pretty too. One of these had once wandered up to me, staring me in the eyes. It looked angry. 

Her clacking high heels went silent when she stopped in front of my mom giving a curtsy. Even if we were the guests of the Duke himself, proper etiquette had to be observed. We couldn’t lift our heads until told by a higher ranking person. This was one of the things that I didn’t like about noble etiquette. My grandmother didn’t care much about it, but there were so many rules and proper ways to do things. Dinner etiquette had been easy because it was logical, but the things I learnt were more akin to nonsense. My aunt stood there for a while before clicking her tongue and strutting away, her two daughters in tow. My mom looked exhausted already. 

“When will your husband arrive?” The Duke cut into his steak.

My fox-like aunt dabbed her mouth with a napkin before answering. “Who knows?”

My grandfather sat at the end like always with his firstborn son to his right and his daughter to the left. Their family trickled downwards before ending up at the end where my parents and I sat. The first time I saw this table, I thought it to be unnecessarily long. Yet seeing all the seats filled it looked rather small today. My grandmother didn’t attend today’s dinner.

“My dear sister, you shouldn’t answer our father like that”, my uncle said. “He must be running late with his business again, father.”

“What would you know about my husband, Gilbert?”

“Many would know about your husband, Grace.” It was too far to discern the look on my aunt’s face, but the big gulp of wine she drank gave me a rough idea.

“That’s enough”. The Duke let out a sigh.

“Your Grace, you shouldn’t sigh that much. I heard a little happiness disappears each time\!” My uncle’s wife chirped. I heard another sigh leak out.

“Where is mother? Is she not well today too?” Uncle Gilbert asked. 

“We will talk about that matter after dinner.”

Aunt Grace took another swig of wine. “Is that why you had us all called here? You even managed to find Galen.” It was audible when they all turned their heads towards my father.

“And why is it that they are sitting at our table?” 

“The Duke had graciously extended an invitation to us, which makes us honorable guests deserving to sit here.”

“Hah, does that mean she is also an honorable guest?” She pointed her knife at my mom. “I can’t believe you have the nerve to show your face back here and even to deign to sit with us.” The bloody droplets dripped as she bounced it up and down. What did my mom do to experience such animosity?

“Grace”, the Duke called her name.

“I can’t believe it.” She stood up. “I’ve lost my appetite, please excuse me.” Her sharp heels clacked as she left. Her children didn’t even react to this breach of conduct, as if it was a common occurrence. I looked at my mom’s face but she still had that smile she taught me. That smile didn’t fit her.

“She comes and goes like the storm that one”, my other aunt said. “I can’t imagine how her husband must feel.”

“Don’t say that, dear. It’s an honor to be able to wed into our family. My sister must just be tired from the long journey is all. Isn’t that right, father?”

My father put down his fork. “If it is such an honor, then why is he not here with us then? The duke personally invited him after all. What you are saying is not making sense, Lord Gilbert.”

“Oh, did I ask for your opinion by mistake? Galen.”

“Stop it, I’m getting a headache just hearing you all speak.”

The rest of the dinner was as silent as the grave. Only the occasional clatter of silver hitting porcelain could be heard. The adults had gone off to meet my grandmother making us children the only ones left sitting in the adjoining tea room. 

This was my first time seeing noble children and my imagination had been too much. They looked just like normal children. The brothers were busy playing cards and calling each other things like: you suck, you’re bad, and I will win next time. The older sister was reading a book while sitting with a straight back and in front of me stood the younger one. Her hair was styled into twintails, a green ribbon adorning each of the tails. Her round eyes were staring at me.

“Hello\! I’m Leah. Who are you?”

“Hello, my name is Esther.” 

“You’re really pretty\! How old are you?”

“I’m fourteen this year.”

“Wow\! You’re the same as my big sister, your names sound the same too\! Estelle and Esther\!” She bounced up and down excitedly.

“Do you want to play with me? My sister is always reading or doing boring stuff…”

“If you will allow me”

She giggled. “You talk just like an old lady\!” 

We were playing with a piece of string. It was surprisingly fun. Making new shapes as it wrapped around my fingers as I tried to copy what she did. I couldn’t do the more complex shapes because of my stiff left hand. 

“You.” Estelle was standing in front of us. 

“What month is your birthday?” Is this how noble children greeted each other? I didn’t have enough reference to know.

“It was in February.” 

She smirked. “Mine’s in January”.

A monk once said that children have a tendency to follow in their parent’s footsteps, good or bad. I had vehemently denied that theory, but as to mock me. Cases where it supported his theory kept popping up. If her mother was a fox, then she would be a cat. She had long straight hair with a green accessory in her hair. Her eyes looked at me like that of a predator looking at prey. The way she crossed her arms and tilted her hip made me unreasonably irritated. I could tell she was looking down on me. 

“What did you think about Alcove’s Exhaltations?”

“I have not read that.” The library only permitted family members to enter, making me only stand outside the door and glare at the bookkeeper who always sat in his seat. Nonetheless, even if I had gotten access, a book titled Exaltations sounded nonsensical. Who could be so happy as to write a book about it? 

“So you haven’t come that far yet, what about The journey of Deborah?” Why was she looking so proud?

“Oh, I liked that one\!” Leah nodded. I could only shake my head.

“What? Not even that one?” 

She continued to mention book titles, almost like expecting me to at least have read at least one of them.

“The monster encyclopedia?”

“Oh, that I’ve read.”

“Hey“, she called out. “Who’s your tutor? Yours doesn't sound good. Mine was countess Belford.” My finger twitched.

“I don’t have a tutor.”

“You don’t have a tutor? Everyone has a tutor. Where did you learn etiquette then?” What was with all these questions? It was like how that detective had questioned me. “You are better than those dull boys over there.”

“I learnt from my mother”

Her eyes went wide. “That woman? You’re lying.” Why was she calling my mother ‘that woman’? 

“I’m not lying and her name is Victoria.” I couldn’t even lie if my life depended on it. 

“Why should I know her name? She’s not even a noble.” She poked my forehead. “I heard that woman is just a commoner.” Poke, poke. “A lowly orphan servant commoner.” 

I wanted to kill her right there and then.

\*\*\*  
I found myself back in my room when I came back to. My gloves sat on the table in front of me letting the sun warm up my hands. The light rippled as it hit my left hand casting waves of shadows across the skin. I tried to forget the incident where I got caught, but just like the morning sun. The icing pain reminded me every single day that I had failed that day. Killing wasn’t something I particularly enjoyed, I did it out of necessity. 

I still remember the first time I did it. It was some old woman sleeping on the ground. Everyday on the same spot, at the same time and every time I walked from the house, she slept there. On that piece of tattered cardboard. There was one day when she didn’t sleep there. A miracle I thought. No more would I have to see her dirty clothes and that dirty paper cup staining my view. Alas, the very next day she was back again. Still sleeping and still dirty. That was when I couldn’t take it any longer. I wanted her gone.

My trip from the house got remarkably better after that day. Sure, her shocked expression as I jammed a knife in her throat still surfaced whenever I slept or ate or studied or went to the toilet, but that was far better than seeing her sorry state at the corner of the street. 

A week after my first murder, Ann pulled me to the side to ask me something.

# Chapter 16

Karrie always said that my mom was several times better than her own. I had agreed each time because it was simply true. Victoria was prettier with her unblemished fair skin and silky smooth hair, she wasn't too thin nor too thick and she had a gentle voice and face. This isn’t meant to make Karrie’s mom appear to be some hideous person, she was just, average. 

However, standing here with my hands behind my back, I felt scared. Gone was the gentle mother who always gave me a hug, gone was the gentle smile she always had, and gone was my fantasy of unconditional love. Victoria was standing there with a face that I never wanted her to wear. I couldn’t look at her any longer and watched my feet instead. 

“Esther\!” She was yelling. 

“How could you just shove her like that\!” My ears rang.

“Victoria, it was just children arguing. Besides, no one got hurt.”

“Getting hurt or not, she shouldn’t have resolved to use violence\! What if we get kicked out?”

“Wouldn’t that be for the best?”

“Take this seriously Galen\! She hurt a noble\!”

“I don’t get what’s so special about nobles.” I said.

“Esther\!” Her shout stunned me. The floorboards stayed silent.

“Why Esther\! What if she broke something\!”

“What am I going to do? I have to apologize to Lady Estelle. I have to apologize to Lady Grace. I have to apologize…”

“There is so much happening\! Why is this happening\!?” 

“Victoria\! Stop that\!” My mother was pulling at her hair. 

“Esther, go wait outside for a bit, okay?”

I collapsed in front of the door, my knees couldn't bear my own weight anymore. My fingers couldn’t stop trembling and my heart hurt. If only I could remove this useless organ. Remove everything. I always thought my mother to be a strong person. Hell or heaven she always wore a smile. It always made me feel at ease. But the muffled yelling I heard behind the door made me regret ever having that thought. Then I heard blood-curdling wailing. Then I heard sobbing. And then it went quiet. My mother wasn't strong, she was just pretending.

The movement of the door made me flinch. My fathers face peeked out. 

“Esther, you’re still here?”

“Dad, I’m sorry…” 

“Oh, dear, come here.” My vision soared to his eye level.

“Let’s let your mother rest for a bit, okay? She is just a little tired is all.” I could only nod as I watched the golden circle blind me.

My father had carried me somewhere with a tea table. I watched as I saw him put three sugar cubes in my cup. It was hot. He hadn’t said anything while he carried me nor did he say anything as we sat. He was just staring at me. What would he say if I told him his daughter was dead?

“Can you tell me why you did it?”

“She said bad things about mom…”

“What things?”

“She called her an orphan servant…”

“Hah…” 

“I would normally tell you you did well, I really can’t this time.”

“Do you know why your mother is always so sad?” I shook my head.

“It’s because of me.” What was he saying?

“Because of your useless father, your mother had to experience things that slowly chipped away at her heart. Eventually, we had you and her heart began to fix itself.” He smiled.

“That’s why you are our treasure, do you understand, Esther?”

“Not really…”

“It’s fine if you don’t understand right now. Just make sure you are happy and healthy okay?” I nodded. 

“Want to go visit your mother?”

“Yeah…” 

My mother had fallen asleep. Her eyes were red and puffy and her hair was messy. Her fists were clenching the blanket as if it was the most important thing in the world. Looking into the mirror, I saw a similar face looking back. Puffy red eyes. I seemed to have cried along the way. My heart felt heavy as I looked at my mother, she was pitiful. There had to be a way to help her. I crept into her bed and under her blanket. It was warm as I nestled myself against her. I’m sorry mom.

TK tea party with grandmother and estelle.

“Have you two made up?” I glanced at Estelle.

Today was another day where I was to have tea with the Duchess and Estelle was joining us. 

“I have already said my apologies. I’m waiting for mine.” Apologizing to her was no easy feat. Whenever I tried to say ‘I’m sorry’ or ‘I didn’t mean to’ the golden circle blocked my mouth. In the end my apology had only vague words and phrases.

“You call that an apology? You just said some nonsense\!”

“Better that than nothing at all.”

“Oh my girls, that’s not how you reconcile with each other." My grandmother smiled at us. 

“Why would I reconcile with her? She’s a violent person\!”

“Would you rather get angry every time you meet her?”

“Yes\!”

“That would be exhausting, Estelle. Do you know why you are angry?”

“Of course I do\! It’s because–” She thought for a second. “Because her mom is a bad person\!” She was still on with this? I had to control myself.

“And what about Eshter over here, why are you angry at her?”

“She pushed me\!”

“But you said some hurtful things did you not? What would you do if Esther was the one who said the same things you said.” 

“I would…” 

“It seems you have now understand, putting yourself in others' shoes is the first thing you have to do to learn to communicate with others. New perspectives will broaden your sights, you have read a lot of books have you not?”

“However, Esther. You should have tried to solve the conflict with your words instead of your hands. As such I want you to give an apology first, can you do that?” 

Solving things with words? I almost burst out into laughter hearing that coming from her. Words had never worked when it mattered the most. People will choose to ignore words or nitpick the parts that they themselves like. A word could have several meanings for different people, but getting hit in the face? That will make them immediately understand the meaning. And she wants me to give an apology first? 

“Why should I apologize first again. She was the one who insulted my mother.”

“Are you angry at her, Esther?”

“Yes, wouldn’t that be obvious?”

“Then all the more reason to apologise first.” I couldn’t help but think of the Duchess as being absurd. 

TK little more dialogue.

“Try it.” How am I supposed to say something I didn’t even mean? This thing wouldn’t make me be able to lie either. 

“Would you rather your mom apologize for you?” I saw her gray eyes stare at me. I had forgotten. The real reason why I willingly attended today’s tea party even when Estelle was here. My mom had told me that morning that she was sorry for yelling at me, and that she would take care of it. She had smiled as usual but the illusion had already broken. I saw myself reflected in her eyes. This was something I had to solve myself. She already sacrificed so much of herself.

I turned to Estelle. She had an irritating face. Her lips looked pale, her eyes were too sharp, and she would definitely develop wrinkles with the way she was furrowing her eyebrows. 

“Lady Estelle, I was angry at you when you said those things, but I shouldn’t have retaliated in that manner. I want to apologise.” It had been a while since I bowed my head to apologize. 

“Well… I did say some harsh things. You can just call me Estelle…”

The rest of the tea party continued while the Duchess had a wide grin on her face.

“Grandmother, is it true that you are dying?”

“Where did you hear that?”

“Everywhere…”

“Then it must be true.” She sipped her cup of tea.

TK scene with aunt where she is drunk and says how similar she is to victoria, hint background lore.

My aunt had called for me when she spotted me going back to my room. She was resting in the lounge drinking wine. 

“You, what’s your name”

“It is Esther, my lady”

“Funny.”

“Come closer” I felt her floral fragrance as I stepped closer. It was mixed in with the smell of alcohol. 

“You really do look like her…” 

“You can go now.” I curtsied and left the room.

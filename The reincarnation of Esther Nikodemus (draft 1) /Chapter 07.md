# Chapter 7: Finn

Hearing something plink at his window, Finn woke up after the third time it happened. With heavyset feet, he shuffled to the window, opening it. He thought it was one of the boys always hanging out with him. Instead, under his window stood someone unexpected. It was Esther. Her golden hair glistened in the moonlight. She was about to throw another pebble until she noticed him.

“Ah, there you are." She said cheerfully.

“Esther? What are you doing here?” It was in the middle of the night.

“Come down, I want to talk with you”

“Right now?” Finn was about to refuse, hadn’t it been Esther who asked. “Give me a second”

What did she want to talk about? Did she change her mind? That must be it. His heart rate rose a bit higher. With a light gait, he left his room, listed down the stairs; careful not to wake up his dad, and finally arrived at the front door. 

He grabbed the door handle. As the mechanism in the door began to operate, clicking sounds reverberated across the entrance. The silhouette was standing there in the door gap. Esther was already in front of the door, waiting, smiling. 

Finn couldn’t help but let out a yelp as she had been closer than he thought. 

“Did I scare you?” Her blue crescent moon shaped eyes sparkled in the darkness.

“Not really…”

“Come follow me\!” The words flowing from her soft lips felt almost enchanting. 

Finn followed after the girl. “Where are we going?” 

“Just a bit further?” She said without turning.

“What do you mean?” They had walked quite the distance. “What did you want to talk about?” Wasn’t the boy supposed to be the one asking the girl out?

She finally stopped. They were standing in the middle of the forest.

Finn had often played in this very forest, sometimes even camping outside with his dad. They had liked this place since it was so quiet. Esther glanced around.

“This looks like a good spot”

“A spot for what?” He felt his heart thumping, almost wanting to jump out of his chest. Was this actually going to happen?

“I have a confession I want to make.” She hid her hands behind her back. 

Oh, my goddess. Calm down. His palms were sweaty, his knees felt heavy. Play it cool, Finn.

“W-what is it?” Damn it, his voice cracked.

“I think you already know.” She smiled shyly. “Close your eyes for me?”

Done, eyes closed. He could hear her soft footsteps inch closer and closer. 

“You know Finn…” She trailed the last sound of his name. “I really. Really, really. Hate people like you\!” A sudden sharp feeling poked at his throat, throwing him over backwards. Opening his eyes in shock, Esther was standing there. The dagger she held glinted in the moonlight.

What? Why didn’t it pierce his neck?

“Huh?” The boy on the ground said stupidly. “Did you just stab me?” He was touching the spot where I had thrusted. Good observation idiot.

“Stay away\!” He scrambled to his feet to get away from me. He hit the ground again as he tripped over his own legs, planting his face into the dirt. Pathetic. 

This wasn’t the time to observe. With light feet, I bounced over to where he laid. He had turned over like a turtle legs sprawling out towards me. “What are you doing\!” He began crawling backwards on his back. Eventually hitting one of the many trees in the dim forest. 

I looked down at him, standing in between his legs. I raised my dagger again. I probably just missed last time. I still didn’t move this body that smoothly. 

Standing in between his legs, I looked down at him. He was like an insect, a worm, squirming around. I better make him stay still. The last attack was probably just a miss. I wasn’t hundred percent familiar with this body yet. Lifting my dagger in the air the moonlight seemed to envelop it, making it shine like silver. 

“Stop\!”

I slammed down my dagger.

“Aaa\!”

I heard the scream but the soft flesh of a person was nowhere to be felt. My dagger had bounced off. 

I stabbed again

It bounced off again. A yellow circle sparkled under the tip of my dagger.

What was happening?

Finn looked at me with a shocked expression before finally realizing the size difference. I could see the horizon flip over as I saw a leg land squarely into my gut. The knife flew across my vision, shining like a star.

Groaning, I tried to gather air back into my lungs. It hurt. I spat out the dirt in my mouth, what happened to the plan?

“You’re crazy\!” He stood up. “You’ve gone insane\!”

Don’t say that. I am not insane. 

“What do I do, what do I do?”

I tried to move my body, but it just hurt so much. 

“Dad, I have to wake up dad\!”

Feeling the dirt underneath my hands, I tried pushing myself off the ground. I need to run. I was good at running. I just need to run for today.

“You did this to yourself\!”

Something approached and slammed into my head. My mind went blank.

\*\*\*

“Wake up sleepyhead, class’ done already.” 

Where am I? A girl was sitting on my desk as she checked her phone.

“Hellooo? Earth to \*\*\*” A hand appeared in front of me, waving back and forth. 

“Karrie?” What’s she doing here?

“Karrie? Who’s that? I’m Ann, stupid. Your one and only friend. Did you have a silly dream or something?”

I glanced around, it was my old classroom. There were some formulas written on the blackboard, but it seemed like greek to me, literally. 

I glanced at Ann, she was wearing our school uniform.

“Whats the date?”

“Wow, gross... Did you read too many stupid books again? Here check it out”

Turning her phone toward me, I saw the date. It was 20XX.

“That can’t be…”

I could hear the bustling noises of people walking outside our classroom.

“What do you mean?” Ann placed a pencil on the tip of her nose, balancing it.

“I killed you, you are supposed to be dead.” The pencil snapped in half, each half making a sound as it hit my desk.

“Oh, right”

The scene shattered, everything disappearing. 

Ann was currently laying in a casket. Countless people had gathered together, all wearing black. I couldn’t recognize them, they were all wearing funeral veils. I couldn’t see their faces. The sounds of crying could be heard all over, It was maddening. 

“Is this better?”

Plastered all around were huge flower crests. The fragrant smell coming out of them made me sick. I felt my sweat trickle down my back, I felt the arms of them grabbing onto me. I felt the urge to run out of the funeral hall. I needed to puke.

Standing atop her own casket, Ann stared down at me. 

“Tell me.”

A pair of brown eyes pierced my own. I averted my gaze. I didn’t want to look at her.

“Did you really have to kill me?”

She was smiling in the corner of my eye.

\*\*\*

“You did well my son. Just go back to sleep. Your dad will sort out this misunderstanding."

I couldn’t see.

“It wasn’t a misunderstanding\! She tried to kill me\! Look\!”

My head ached.

“I understand, just go back to your room.”

“But Dad\!”

My hands were tied.

“I won’t say it twice”

He paused. “What are you going to do”

My legs were tied.

“Go to your room”

The sound of footsteps getting farther and farther away. A door opened and slammed shut.

“I know you are awake, kid.”

“Where am I”

“Somewhere secret.” He answered. “Oh I almost forgot”

The thing covering my eyes disappeared. A singular lamp lit up the room. There were a bunch of tools hanging on the wall. This place looked to be some carpenter’s workshop.

“You’re surprisingly calm for being tied up.” The middle aged man harrumphed. He looked like an older version of Finn.

“What do you want?” I glared at him.

“Straight to the point I see.” The corners of his mouth reached his eyes.

I tried to break free from my bondage.

“Ah, ah ah\!” He sang, wagging his finger at me. “Don’t waste your energy, no one has broken free before\!” He seemed proud.

“Does your son know about your disgusting hobby?” There had to be a way out of here

“Oh he knows. But you are mistaken.” He grabbed my head. “It's not disgusting”  
   
“What? Chopping off their heads is not disgusting?” There was a familiar sickly sweet fragrance in the air mixed in with the dust.

“They deserved it.” he stated matter-of-factly.

“I see”, the rope was digging into my wrists, “you’re just insane.”

“Me? Insane? You tried to kill my son\!” His face looked like a demon. “You are the insane one here\!” Some spittle from his mouth landed on my cheek.

“What did he do to you\!”

“It’s personal”

“Hah\! Is that right? Personal.” He picked up a hammer.

“Then would it be personal if I paid your mother a visit? What was her name again, Victoria?” He licked his smiling lips. Then it went back to being a demon.

“That damn vixen\! Always flaunting herself everywhere she goes\! Who does she think she is\!” The hammer moved erratically around, casting shadows in the room.

He calmed himself. “That’s right, I can just pay her a visit. A personal one.” 

“Don’t…” I mumbled.

He took a step closer. “What was that?”

“Don’t…” He turned his ear toward me, getting closer. “Don’t you dare touch her\!” I slammed into his head with my own, falling over in the process, chair and all.

“You touch her and I will kill-”

I felt the tip of his shoe digging into my gut. “You demon brat\!”

I spat out blood.

“That does it, after I’m finished with you.” He yanked my hair “Your pretty little mother is next.”

He set me back up. I had to get out of here, Victoria was in danger. I have to at least tell Gale. Think, there had to be a way out-

He lifted the hammer above my hands.

“Wait”

The hammer ascended higher. He was grinning.

“Wait, stop\!”

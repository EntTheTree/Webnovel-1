# Chapter 17

Franzsiska thought that this was too easy. Already in a week, she had gathered several necklaces, rings and even jewels. A rich noble house is the best\! The idiots didn’t even expect anything as they all went around looking for their lost things. However she had a problem, the little girl she was ‘tutoring’ was starting to get on her nerves.

How is it that she already went through the whole ‘curriculum’ she had planned? And the way she stared at her, not a single emotion could be felt from that stare. 

“Now spin around the other way.”

“That's not it, I said the other way.”

“Baroness”, she had stopped saying her full title, “I don’t see why I need to spin while holding a tea cup."

How unruly, always talking back at her. “Just do as I say.”

The lesson ended and Franzsiska could finally relax after a hard day’s work of ordering a child to do her bidding. A sense of fulfilment filled her big heart. Now, let's go see where else things could be taken.

Her steps led her to a corner in the hallway. A girly voice and a womanly voice could be heard talking behind that corner. 

“What a pretty little box you are holding there\! Did you make it?”

“Do I really look like I can make these types of things?”

“Hmm, not really. What’s inside it?”

“I don’t know, I don’t have the key.”

Franzsiska peeked from the corner and saw the little girl holding a box. Not just any box. Her box. It was her box full of her treasures. 

“What a shame, how about asking one of the knights to break it open?”

“Should I?”

What was that maid saying\! And don’t agree with her for Goddess’ sake\!

“Oh, greetings Baroness Bayonne. What brings you here?” She had been lurking around on the third floor, where important guests had their rooms. 

“What is that box you’re holding?” 

“I found it while exploring. Have you seen it before?” The girl asked, her eyes still devoid of emotions. It was honestly puzzling. 

“I don’t know whose box that is, but don’t you think the owner will get distressed seeing it gone?”

“Did you steal it, miss? That’s bad\!” The maid flapped her arms.

“I don’t think they would mind, but I suppose I have to return it.”

“That’s right, all these lessons and you are still so childish. Return it back to their room.”

“Room?” She tilted her head. “I found this in the abandoned church?”

TK write an explenation on how this was not a lie. Maybe the box just looked similar. 

“What?”

“It sat under one of the benches. Maybe the goddess hid it there?” That can’t be. Was she lying?

“Well, wherever you found it, make sure to return it back.” She had to check her room right now.

It was gone. Her sole reason for mingling with the upstuck nobles was gone. That girl had tricked her. She mentioned the church? Where in the great heavens would a church be in this place. Information. Franzsiska needed to gather information.

She asked a maid.

“A church? Why would there be a church here? But I’m not familiar with the land. Maybe one of the older ones knows? Should I ask for you?”

She asked the cook.

“You can’t be in here, baroness or not. A kitchen is like a battlefield—”

She asked the elderly gardener.

“Haha, did little Esther tell you about it? She must be really fond of you, Baroness.” The gardener rambled on and on the importance a teacher had on their student and finally told her the location of the abandoned church. The sun had already began to fall when he finished. Franzsiska stood in front of the forest pondering whether to enter it.

Pitch black darkness flooded the sea of trees and overgrown wildlife. She did not want to go in there. But what if the girl really broke the lock? At least let me get a lamp, she thought.

Spotting the abandoned church hidden in the overgrown forest, Franszsiska thought it was ugly. The moonlight illuminated through the countless holes and she even saw TKsomething. Priests had always liked to drone on and on about the importance of life and all that. How stealing was bad and moderation was important. Then why did they have so many shiny golden things? If she was to be lucky, then some hidden treasures could be found.

She approached the altar and began searching. The box was priority, anything else could be done after that. Her brilliant green dress got stained with dirt and dust as she searched under the benches. There was nothing. How about behind the altar? No luck. Did that girl lie to her? Sitting down on one of the benches she looked at the statue. There it was. Sitting comfortably in the goddess’ arms was the box. 

Being double her size, she had to stand up on her toes to even reach the goddess’ waist. A little more, she struggled. What if she were only use one of her legs? Stretching towards the box, Franzsiska’s body wobbled as she tried to balance herself. The wooden feel on her fingertips filled her with much excitement as she stretched even further, looking almost like a sinner reaching for the heavens. Then she felt it. 

Her fingertips didn’t graze the box any longer and her eyes followed the box as it got further and further away. Her body floated for a while before barreling towards the hard stone floor. Something had swept away her leg. 

“Gah\!” The impact to her back knocked all the air in her lungs and she could feel something sharp stick into her side. Before she could even process the situation, something rough wrapped around her neck and her shoulders got forced downwards. 

Franszsiska's eyes darted around trying to find who was doing this. The pulling made it only possible to look upwards. Moonlight shone a girl’s brilliant golden hair, she looked like an angel with her expressionless face. Damn it\! It was that girl\! She began struggling. Her nails clawed at her neck trying to free herself. It only left red marks on her neck. The pressure on her shoulders increased with a grunt coming from the little girl. Her trachea let out a crack as her throat got crushed from the winch on her neck. And so, franzsiska blacked out.

Did she finally pass out? The golden circle appeared before my eyes as I saw her hands stop clawing at the rope. Haa… my body would surely ache tomorrow. I had successfully done the first half of the plan, the hard part was coming now. How could I kill her?

I stabbed her with the knife I got from the knight. The golden circle blared like a warning signal. Okay, that’s to be expected, how about giving her a cut? I couldn’t quite understand the principle behind the goddess’ whims. Maybe it was just that, a whim. Choking her out was ‘allowed’ but giving her a cut was no go. Clenching my fist I gave her head a punch. 

Tsk, I looked at my skin colored stain on my gloves, should have taken them off first. The same could be said about the glove on my left hand. I had tied the rope to the wrist, making it all crumpled under the force. 

I wasn’t someone insane that liked to experiment on human bodies, but this had to be done. Pinching her nose and shutting her jaw together, I waited. Her chest rose with her unconscious breathing, up and down. An increase in tempo was observed as again, the golden circle made me lose the strength in my fingertips. It had jammed itself between my fingers and the nose. 

The next step would be to drown her, but there was no way I could lift her limp body by myself. I looked at her lamp she brought trying to look for other ideas. Worst case scenario, I could hang her. Make her regain consciousness only to suffocate again. It felt a bit cruel to do that as I glanced at her face illuminated by a soft, warm glow. Ah, that’s it. I picked up the lamp.

“Fetch more water\!” The commander roared his orders, getting a thunderous response from all the knights that had gathered in the night. A fire had broken out in the forest behind the annex. It would spread to the building if they weren’t fast enough. 

“Gather all the water stones in the estate\!”

The Duke watched as the knights ran back and forth trying to extinguish the fire that crept along the vegetation. The warm glow rippled in his eyes. 

“Where’s Esther\!” Victoria couldn’t find her. She was nowhere to be seen.

“What do you mean?” Shouldn’t she be sleeping? Children like her had to sleep to grow.

“Gale\! This can’t be happening again\!” 

Damn it\! Why did his daughter always disappear in the middle of the night\! He tried to use his powers to locate her, but there was too much noise. Too many streams of mana had mixed together in this area. He didn’t want to think about it, but there was a high chance he knew where she was.

“Father\!” Gale turned to the Duke. “Order the knights to head to the abandoned church\!”

His son had often asked him for something, but the way his face looked right now was unlike the other times. No anger, no sulking. Only concern and determination. Who was he to reject such a man?

“Commander\! Start heading toward the church\!”

“But, my lord\!”

“That’s an order\!” The duke bellowed. “My granddaughter's life is at stake\!”

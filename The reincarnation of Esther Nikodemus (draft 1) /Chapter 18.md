# Chapter 18

Amazing. Golden circles popped all over Baroness Bayonne's like fireworks. Each time an ember graced her skin it would appear. The sight mesmerized me. Even when surrounded by fire, her body was unharmed. Although the same couldnt be said about her gaudy green dress. The flames, robbed of their meal licked greedily at her dress, turning it into smoke and ash. It irritated my nose.  

Her body laid bare in front of the goddess, covered only by the annoying circles. Was it utterly impossible for me to harm another living being? The crackling sounds and the sharp golden lights filled my thoughts and as if to answer me, they stopped appearing. They weren’t appearing anymore. 

Like a flash of lighting, her skin burned in a second. It even began to bubble in some areas. The fire had even spread to the vines laying under her as it catched her melting fat. It spread outwards like a spider net, eventually finding itself at the feet of the goddess. The vines wrapping around the goddess had catched on fire and began crawling upwards. 

“Ha ha\!” 

A laugh slipped out of me when I looked at her pathetic situation. How does it feel when your plan gets thwarted\! Look\! Her body is burning up\! Activate your stupid circles and lets see if it will do anything. Or you can just stand there getting scorched by the flames, see if I care. Her skin was covered by black soot and cracks as the fire dug into her. A picture of a witch burning on the stake filled my mind, fitting.

Baroness Bayonne had become unrecognizable by now. Seeing something white in between the areas of black, I concluded that she had to be dead. There was no she could survive that. 

The church looked like a torch standing there lighting up the surrounding trees. A billow of smoke rose into the night, blanketing the round stars. The moldy wooden roof had begun to burn, and with a loud crash, it collapsed on itself, sending several embers into the air and onto the orange trees. Crap. A forest fire had broken out. Sorry your Grace, I didn’t intend to burn the whole place down. 

Peeking from a tree at the edge of the forest, I saw a gathering of people standing in front of me. Several knights were busy running back and forth from the estate to the forest, all the while holding buckets. The crackling sounds behind me edged closer and closer the longer I watched, a slight warmt touched my back. 

“Cut down the trees\!” My father’s booming voice cut through the air. He was dangerously close to me. Hopping from tree to tree, I hid myself while widening our distance. Running back towards the church. Thumps filled the glowing forest as the ground shook from the impact of the felled trees. 

Hastening my pace, my lungs felt like burning. He was getting closer and closer. The dark forest flitted by me as I ran in the opposite direction. It was the first time my height worked in my favor as the branches couldn’t even block my path. But it didn’t help my current situation, I was stuck between the growing fire and my father.

“Eshter\!” Oh, he found me. He looked angry as well. 

TK make esther get scolded by victoria for the first time/ mixed with a view of her real mother

Karrie had always said that my mom was several times better than her own. I had agreed each time because it was simply true. Victoria was prettier with her unblemished fair skin and silky smooth hair, she wasn't too thin nor too thick and she had a gentle voice and face. This isn’t meant to make Karrie’s mom appear to be some hideous person, she was just, average. 

However, standing here with my hands behind my back, I bit my lips. Gone was her gentle voice, gone was her gentle smile, and gone was the gentle mother who always gave me a hug. Victoria was standing there with a face that I never wanted her to wear. I averted my gaze and watched my feet instead. They were dirty.

“Esther\!” My shoulders jumped.

“What were you thinking\! How could you think of running towards the fire\! You could have gotten hurt\!”

“Mom…”

“I don’t want to hear it\! Do you know how scared I felt when you weren’t in your room again? And then the fire broke out\!”

I felt my throat seize up.

“What were you thinking\!”

My ears rang.

“Is it your intention to always worry me?\!” She was scary.

“You’re going to ruin this family\!”

“M-mom I didn’t—”

“How am I going to pay the bills now?\! All you had to do was pour him a drink, its not that hard is it\!”

“But he was making me uncomfortable…”

“So what\! You don’t think I feel uncomfortable every working day?\! I had to even pay off their complaints\!” She was grabbing at her hair. She had used a lot of time to curl them this morning. Now it was all messed up.

My mother grabbed her half drunk bottle. “AHHH\!” It slammed into the kitchen wall. The small remaining amount of liquid dripped down the walls. Making it even more dirty.

“How could you not even entertain one damn guest\! You’re such a failure\!”

“M-mom please calm d-down.”

“How the hell am I supposed to calm down\! You think it was easy getting that job, huh? Do you have any idea the things I had to do\!?”

“Mom… I’m sorry…” I grabbed at her legs on my knees.

“Let go of my you disgusting parasite\!”

“I w-will do better next time\!” I had to help my mother. She was always working so hard. That’s right, that’s all I needed to—

Smack\! “There is no damn next time\!” My head hit the messy floor. Why was it always so messy.

“Get the hell out of my house\!” 

“Mom…” The pain made me cry. 

“I should have never had you\!”

She didn’t mean that. I just had to wait a little. I just had to wait until she opened the door again.

“Mom, let me in please\! Open the door\!” Whether my hands were red from the cold night or the banging on the locked door, I don’t know. I just know that my mother would let me in soon.

“I swear to do better\! Please\!” She would let me in soon.

“Mom… don’t abandon me…”

“What’s wrong?”

“I didn’t mean to worry you…”

“I know you did, I’m sorry for yelling at you.”

“It’s my fault… it’s all my fault mom…”

“Don’t say that, you’re my daughter.”

“Please, hic\! Don’t abandon me again.”

“Huh?”

“I’m sorry mom, I will do anything, please give me another chance\!” Why couldn’t I just pour them a drink.

“Sweetie, what are you saying?” Fill their cup with that disgusting liquid.

“I will help us get money\! I will help you at work\!” I tried to smile. I had to.

“Esther, what are you saying?”

“You won’t have to worry about me anymore\! Just don’t throw me out\!”

“Gale, something is wrong with her\!”

“Mom, it’s scary…”

“Esther\!” Something shook my body.

“It’s scary…”

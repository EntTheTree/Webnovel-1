# Chapter 1: Reincarnation

Standing there in front of the statue, I couldn’t help but glare at it. It was a gold-plated statue of a buddha. A master craftsman had probably sculpted it, declaring it his life’s work, getting praised by all the monks visiting. But all I felt as it stood there, towering over me, was irritation. Its expression seemed to be mocking me. A perfectly symmetrical smug smile. 

I had been shot. Pressing down on the wound in my abdomen did little to stop the warm trail of blood sliding down my legs, staining the wooden floorboards in the process. The smell of incense invaded my nose, the same way the flashing red and blue lights invaded through the shuttered windows, painting away the darkness. 

The sirens were still blaring and occasional shouts could be heard surrounding this secluded temple. A familiar voice echoed through the night through the help of a megaphone.

“You are surrounded\! Come out with your hands up\!” 

It was the detective that has been chasing me for the past few weeks. 

I had a nagging feeling of being watched and got my suspicions confirmed when he showed up at the temple. He had asked me a bunch of questions but not once did he write down my answers. He just stared at me. I stared back, at his peculiar scar over his left eye.

In this bustling concrete jungle of a city, stood a lonesome temple on the outskirts of top of a hill. Instead of skyscrapers surrounding it, trees and plants did instead. Having nowhere else to go, I eventually found myself standing before this very place. A monk sweeping the grounds had greeted me, introduced himself and then broke out into a long winded lesson, regaling the history of the temple. 

Did I ask for this service? No. Did I ask him to stop? No, of course not. This happened more often than I would admit, someone finding me and blathering on and on about this or that. He looked increasingly more cheerful the more he talked, hitting all the bullet points. I must have been the only one that listened to his whole presentation.

Having learnt all the ins and outs of the temple, the monk invited me to have a meal as a reward. Having nothing but the shirt on my back, I accepted. Stuffing my face with food for the first time in a while, my body just wanted to lay down and sleep. Noticing this, the monk offered me a room to use, perhaps noticing my predicament. I, a young girl, had just wandered into a temple with nothing.

The room was intended for monks-in-training but no one had shed their modern life in recent years. The room had a mattress and that was it. It was bare. It was like looking into a mirror. I accepted the room.

The monks at the temple were a little surprised when they saw that a new face had popped up overnight. They began chatting with me immediately, debating to each other about this or that while I stood there, watching. When I had opened my mouth and told them that I wasn’t a new monk in training, I expected them to be a little disappointed. They just smiled gently at me instead.

There were two things stopping me from becoming a real monk-in-training. One, I couldn’t follow the base five precepts. I had already committed one of them. The other reason had something to do with this room, the room with the big statue.

This was my first time in this room. I had tried to enter before but each time, as if some invisible barrier had formed, I couldn’t cross the boundary of the doorway. The golden statue acted like some talisman, protecting itself from me. But strangely enough, I had no problems entering today, my bloody footprints painting a path across the wide floor.

“Death is not the end, nor is life the start. We will all suffer while under the effect of the wheel of reincarnation.” A monk said to me one day. I didn’t really want to die but the thought of reincarnating again seemed to fill me with hope. Maybe I will be a cat in my next life? Laying about and sleeping whenever, or I could be a bird? Spreading out my wings and gliding through the open air. 

The sounds of heavy footsteps came closer and closer and the silhouettes obstructed the windows. Glancing down at my blood-stained knife, I debated which way to die was less painful. Stabbing myself in the neck, or getting shot by those standing over there.

My consciousness flickered in and out as I laid there in front of the statue. In the end, I couldn’t choose how I died. I just bled out with the glowing statue smiling down at me.

\*\*\*

“Detective, is this really her? The one making waves in the headlines lately?”

The officer couldn’t help but ask after seeing the dead body of the girl. He had a daughter about her age. All she did was chat with her friends on the phone and staying up all night.  

“Don’t let her appearance fool you, we already have three confirmed bodies”

“Really? You really can’t judge a book by its cover. How did a girl like her turn into a ruthless killer?” The officer took a picture. “She must have been possessed or something, look at this place. The statues give me the creeps, I tell you” He rubbed his arms.

“Enough chatting, wrap it up and give me that report. The media and higher ups have been on my ass ever since that incident.”

“What a shame, he was about to retire and all…”

“He had a promotion lined up and all…” The detective left to light a smoke.

“Good riddance.” Draping a sheet of cloth over the girl, the officer began with his report.

\*\*\*  
My hands lit up as I injected the girl with my divine mana. It didn’t work.

“Father\!” The mother looked distraught, “My daughter, she will wake up won’t she? She must be just sleeping, right?”

Having looked over this girl from late morning to late night, I could only come to one conclusion. Her daughter won’t be able to open her eyes again.

“I’m sorry… it’s not working…” Divine magic was supposed to heal all except for a few cases. Cases where the patient was going to die no matter what. I had expended all of mana.

“She doesn't have long…” 

It was never easy telling a parent about the fate of their child. The woman wailed as she held unto her dying daughter.

“You should start the ritual”. The goddess had given us magic and rituals to help us live. The ritual would ensure a safe passage for a person’s soul on its destination to the pearly gates.

“No\!” She cried. “I won’t do it\! She’s not dead\! My baby, open your eyes please\!”

She grabbed my garment, pleading. “You can use healing magic can't you? Why isn’t it doing anything?\!”

I stayed silent.

Even if divine magic couldn’t turn a terminal ill person into a healthy person, it should still have had some effect. But each time I tried to inject her with mana, it simply bounced off. She must already be dead.

“Oh my baby, please open your eyes. What am I supposed to do without you\!”

The plethora of plants and medicines sprawled across the room, seemed to tell about the girl’s long struggle against her body. Hearing what the mother said, I couldn’t imagine how it must have been living with an unknown incurable disease. Being bedridden whenever she walked too far, getting life endangering fevers for no reason, and not being able to retain her food. What a pitiful life this child has lived.

At least she seemed to be at peace laying there on the bed. A sharp contrast to the haggard looking mother, despair evident on her face. Her golden blonde hair laid to her sides. Her mother had combed it, holding onto whatever hope she had for her daughter. Probably expecting her to wake up any moment now. Apart from her hair, she also inherited the color of her eyes. The pair of brilliantly blue eyes reflected the light from the magic-powered lamp and stared at her mother. They could almost be mistaken for being sisters. Hmm? Staring?

“What am I to tell your father\!” Her tears dropped onto the girl's cheek, leaving a trail as it plopped onto the pillow.

“What…”

Flinching from the unexpected sound, her tears stopped in their tracks. 

What? How is this possible?

“Oh my goddess\!” She let out a yell full of joy. “My baby\!”

“A miracle… This must be a miracle…” I have just witnessed a real miracle. I must document this.

I rummaged through my bags to find something to write on, and while the mother hugged her child shedding tears of joy, the words from the little girl stopped us both from moving.

“Who are you?” A hoarse voice called out.

\*\*\*

The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was a beautiful crying woman. An angel? That can’t be. I can’t be in heaven. The woman seemed to be shocked about something. Her expression mirrored the expression of the man next to her, who wore some really gaudy white clothes reminiscent of the priests that had visited the temple. 

Didn’t I die? Glancing downwards the view shocked me. This wasn’t my body. When I thought of moving my hand, a small childlike hand moved accordingly instead. An unnatural gold-colored hair flowed brightly down my face and my chest had gotten a bit smaller… 

This had to be a dream, but my body ached too much for me to really believe that. Everything hurt as I laid there in the bed. The pain was even worse than being shot.

With all the strength I could muster, I focused on the woman. “Who are you?” Wow, even my voice was different. 

I stared absentmindedly at the bowl of porridge in my hands. The warmth from it seeped through my hands, heating up my body a little. Its grayish color didn’t exactly whet my appetite but as the floating spoon flew toward my mouth I had to open it.

*One shouldn’t judge a book by its cover,* I remembered hearing someone say. A subtle sweetness enveloped my tongue as the porridge spread through my mouth and down my throat, warming it up.

The woman looked at me with crescent moon shaped eyes. “How is it?” 

I opened my mouth. “It’s good.” And a childlike voice rang out. “What is it?” 

“I’m glad”, she said with a big smile. “It’s oat porridge, I used to make it whenever you would get sick”. I accepted another spoonful from her.

This woman was supposedly my mother. A pretty person with golden hair, the same hue as mine, and blue eyes reminiscent of a cloudless blue sky. Her youthful appearance would make one wonder if she actually was a mother, her age didn’t show at all.

According to this woman, Victoria, my name was Esther, 13 years old. I had been struggling with illnesses my whole life but it was especially bad this time, even putting me on the edge of death. The priest had said that it was a miracle as a person rejecting healing magic was a sure sign of death. He had no answers as to why I didn’t have any memories, much to Victoria’s chagrin.

Healing magic. Magic. I didn’t really know what to expect anymore, however I knew for a fact by instinct, that the one that was supposed to be in this body, Esther, was dead. I didn’t feel the need to tell them that. Victoria looked gleefully at the now empty bowl of porridge. 

A day has passed since I’ve taken over Esther’s body. My body still hurts all over but speaking has become less of a strain, resulting in me passing the time by asking a bunch of questions to Victoria.

This country was called the Guillain Kingdom and it was currently year 563 of the common calendar. We lived in some town ruled by some baron whose name I couldn’t remember. This was totally different from the earth I knew.

“A planet? Is it some kind of plant?” She was sitting on a chair by my bedside. 

“It’s not a plant, I think. I just remembered the word.”

Her eyes were filled with hope. “Really? Do you remember anything else?”

“No, sorry…” 

“Oh, it’s nothing to be sorry about sweetie, lets just take it slow”

She put her hand onto my head and began patting me. It felt oddly comforting. 

“M-mom?” The word got stuck in my throat. “Can I ask another question?”

“Of course\!” She pumped her fists, cheering me on.

“Do I have a father?”

“Oh…” She looked like a wilted flower. It was kind of amazing how fast she flipped between her emotions.

“He is currently out hunting monsters.”

“Hunting monsters? That sounds dangerous.” I imagined monsters like big snakes and dragons and… I didn’t know any more monsters. 

“They can be…” She looked out the window. “But don’t you worry a bit my little pumpkin, your father is stronger than he looks\! Why do you think I married him?”  
She began singing his praises. I could tell from the way she spoke that they were happily married. I searched through my memories for something involving my father but quickly stopped. It was a stupid idea. 

“Do you think he will be glad to see me?”

“Why do you say that?” Her concerned face came a bit closer as she held my hands.

“I don’t remember him at all.” I felt my hands being squeezed and something warm wrapping around me. She had pulled me into a hug. 

“It doesn’t matter if you remember us or not, just know that we will love you all the same. There is always time for new memories, and who knows? Maybe your memories will come back after a good night’s sleep? You can see your father tomorrow too.”

I could feel the warmth in her words as she swaddled me. It warmed up my body, however a twinge of guilt took root in my heart, where her body warmth had managed to seep into. I didn’t want to let go of this warmth. 

# Chapter 2: Parents

I could hear the front door open downstairs as someone entered the house. My mother was talking to someone with a manly voice before a barrage of footsteps sprinted up the stairs.

“Esther\!” A man barged into the room. The first thing I noticed were his clothes. Leather armor outfitted with metal plates and clinking on his belt was a genuine sword.

“Oh, I shouldn’t have left you\!” He held my hand, pressing it against his head as he knelt by the bed. I could smell something familiar coming from him. It was a smell I knew all too well; the smell of blood.

“You must be my father.”

“Oh my Goddess it was true\!” His eyebrows scrunched together as he seemed ready to cry. Not expecting him to answer, I looked toward my mother for the answer. She had entered the room after him and was consoling her husband. 

“Say hello to your father, dear.” 

He was a handsome man. His sharp jawline was devoid of hair and his obsidian eyes were looking at me warmly under his jet-black hair. Sweat had come together making small streams running down his face. His broad shoulders covered by the armor looked to be from the result of rigorous training. The same could be said for the other muscle parts. My mother must be a great fisherwoman.

My mother explained to him how after he left for the three-day hunt, she had to call over a priest to heal my sudden illness. My body had rejected the healing magic, but she had still held onto hope, until the priest suggested she prepare for a ritual intended for the dying. And then I opened my eyes. 

“I knew those people were quacks\!” My father bellowed.

“Watch what you are saying\!” 

“Why else would healing magic not work\! They must have sent some unqualified dolt\!” He looked just like one of those demon paintings the temple liked to hang up. I never understood why they hung them up.

“I don’t know either, but please calm down.” She pleaded with him. It was only then that he noticed the situation. Messy armor stained with blood, dirty sweat covering his face, and he stank. He took a moment to collect himself. “So she doesn’t remember anything?”

“I think so, she even asked who I was…” Victoria broke out into a sob. 

“Oh honey, come here. I didn’t mean to make you cry.” Now it was the wife’s turn to be consoled.

I watched them silently, not even a thought came to mind, still I felt my heart sink. Esther, are you watching? How am I supposed to act in this situation?

A new day welcomed me as the rays of sun lit up the room and woke me up. A pleasant smell of plants filled the room. My mother had fallen asleep while taking care of me again. She looked exhausted, although the smile on her sleeping face indicated otherwise. Sitting there under the light, the dust being lit by the light looked like stars dancing around her. I better get better soon.

From the conversations I could hear the last few days, the main topic seemed to be about money. The priest had refused payment, stating that he couldn’t accept payment for something the Goddess herself did. My illnesses had been slowly but surely emptying our funds and Gale, my father, had even started to do odd jobs here and there.

The body felt particularly well today and I decided to snoop around the house a bit. Sneaking past my mother, I went out of the room carefully, making sure not to wake her up. The first thing I wanted to see was a mirror. I still hadn’t seen myself. It was most likely to find a mirror in Esther’s room, I figured. My parent’s bedroom that I have been using since I woke up didn’t have one.

Opening the door, a cozy small room greeted me. A bed, half the size of the one I’ve been using, sat against the wall. A desk with a matching chair was placed under a window pointing towards the forest in the distance. The trees seemed even greener than the ones at the temple. 

I searched around the room and for a mirror but found only some books placed haphazardly on the desk. They were all about plants and their medicinal properties. It was interesting how although I had never seen the type of script used in the books before, I could still understand the writing. Was this also magic? I closed the books.  

My body began sweating and my legs wobbled a bit as I left Esther’s room. The small distance between my parent’s room and Esther’s seemed to stretch indefinitely as I waddled back to bed. I somehow managed to make it back.

Victoria had woken up from the noise and stretched her arms in the air like a cat. 

“Good morning, sweetie. Did you sleep well?” I liked seeing her smile rather than crying. 

I nodded.

“It smells like your father is cooking something delicious.” A mouth-watering aroma had filled the house while I was snooping. Victoria gave me headpats again. It felt nice. 

“Oh dear, you are sweating so much\!”. 

Reflected in the puddle was a face resembling Victoria staring absentmindedly at me. I looked just like a smaller version of her, a small angel. I tried to emulate her smile. It looked weird even in this prettier body.

My body had gotten much better the past week with all the rest and food. Today I finally got permission to venture outside of the house. Yesterday’s rain had soaked the garden behind the house, covering every blade of grass with water droplets. 

“Esther\!” Victoria was calling from the kitchen window, “Want to give me a hand with breakfast?”

“Coming\!”

Standing up too fast got me a bit lightheaded, a feeling which had become far too familiar.

Yesterday, my mother suggested I help her with cooking, giving me some vegetables to cut. All I ever did was lie in bed and read the few books available in the house, even beginning to re-read some of them. I accepted her suggestion readily.

The kitchen had some interesting things. A stone that magically, literally, made water appear. A stone that summoned a controllable fire, making cooking easier than using gas stove tops. I had almost burnt down the temple kitchen when I tried to cook something there for the first time.

“Here cut these carrots into cubes, do you need me to show you how?” It seemed she had gotten used to my amnesia, often asking me whether I knew something or not.

“I think I got it.”

It had been a while since I last held a knife. Folding each of my fingers around the handle. My hand wasn’t the same size as before but I could still feel the weight of the knife. I gave it a few flips, it was a terrible knife.

“Is it too heavy?” My mother asked. 

“No, it’s fine” It was not fine. The balance of the knife was out of whack, making one need to use more energy than necessary. Not to mention the dull and nicked blade edge, catching the morning light as I inspected it.

Despite my inner complaints, I still made quick work on the carrots, cutting them into suitable pieces. The monks at the temple had made me help out in the kitchen. I had originally to make something to give back to the monks, and seeing my knifework, asked me to help in the kitchen whenever I had time. I had a lot of time.

“Did you get better at cutting vegetables?” Oh, I got carried away.

“You must have gotten it from me, my daughter is so talented\!” Victoria gushed and gave me a squeeze.

“Mom, I’m holding a knife.” Mom, mom, mom. I don’t think I will ever get comfortable saying that three-letter word.

“Sorry, sorry, you’re just so lovely\!”

“Are these stars?” Victoria studied one of my pieces. “Pretty cute…”

“I think they taste better as stars.” I placed the knife down, making sure the tip pointed away from us.

“Hmm.” She didn’t agree? “Come here\!” 

A full on hugging attack. “How is my daughter this cute\!” I didn’t really understand Victoria sometimes. Nonetheless, whenever she hugged me with her warm arms I couldn't help but feel a bit happier. 

Setting the table for three, Gale came down the stairs groggily.

“What’s for breakfast today?” He asked, slumbering toward his seat at the end.

“Vegetable stew and fried potatoes”. We were now all seated. “Phew, you better wash up afterwards. I can practically smell the alcohol coming from you, how many did you have yesterday”

“I didn’t even get to take a sip, some guy spilled his whole cup all over me”. He took a spoonful of the stew. “Wow, is it just me or did your cooking get better lately?”

“It’s a secret ingredient I added lately.” My mother smirked mischievously. 

He inhaled the bowl of stew. “Poison is it?”

“What nonsense\! Why would I poison the same food as Esther and I are eating.”

“She didn’t deny it…” Gale murmured to me.

“What you are tasting is the sweat and efforts of our daughter. She has helped me out in the kitchen lately.

“Really? She did feel more mature lately, but to think my child is now all grown up…” Fake-wiping his fake tears, he gave me a few pats. 

“I should give a gift to my now all grown up daughter, say it and it shall be yours.” He said theatrically, eliciting a chuckle out of his wife.

“I don’t really need anything.” 

“She really did go and grow up…” Gale slumped his shoulders. “How about this?” Rummaging through his pockets, he pulled out a silver coin. 

“Isn’t a silver coin a bit much, honey? You could buy a day’s worth of food with that”

“This is nothing, wait until you see this.” Leaving the table, he came back with a book in hand.

“I heard you were interested in monsters.” It was a monster lexicon.

“Whoah.” I could finally see what the monsters looked like.

“So my daughter likes monsters more than money, noted”

“Where do you keep finding these books? Aren’t they expensive?”

“Don’t worry, I got this for less than that silver coin”

Flipping through a few pages, I understood why my mother didn’t worry too much about her husband going out and slaying monsters. Each page had a picture and a description of a monster. A rabbit with antlers, a deer with four eyes and other animals with an assortment of features either added or subtracted. Well, I guess you could call these weird animals monsters.

“Speaking of, you know the people I met yesterday? We are currently figuring out the last details about a really good job. A lot of money is sure to be paid out.

“Really? Who are they?”

He explained how some fancy people from out of town had come here to find something, and needed people to show them the way. They wouldn’t give more details until they finalized the contract. 

“We won’t have to worry about money for a while if my gut instinct is correct\!”

“This sounds too good to be true”, my mother seemed suspicious, “I’ve never heard of guarding duty being well paid”

“Well, by the way she was acting, it seemed like the leader was a noble. *I* would know.”

“That makes sense…”

I guess nobles splurged more money than necessary, they sound rich. Anyway, how should I spend this silver coin?

# Chapter 3: Town

“Hey kid, you want to buy something?”

I was currently standing in front of a toady looking street vendor selling meat skewers. The smell of the skewers had enchanted me, making me arrive at this place. It had been a while since I’ve eaten grilled meat.

“Go ask your parents if you’ve got no money”

“How much for a skewer?” My mother had given me a coin pouch to safely carry the silver coin. It was hand-sewed and the name, Esther, was embroidered on it. 

“Five coppers for one, kid.” 

I was about to open my pouch when I saw something glistening in front of the toady man's mouth. It looked like a circle.

“Sorry, could you repeat that?”

“A kid your age already losing their hearing? I said five, coppers.” A golden circle was hovering in front of the man’s mouth, appearing as if to cover it. The golden circle appeared each time he told me the price.

“What about this one?” I pointed to a skewer with only vegetables.

“Four coppers, scram if you’re not going to buy anything.” It appeared again when he said four. Only I seemed to see it.

“Are you lying about the price?”

The vendor paused for a second. “Lying about the price? Who decided that?”

“Do you want me to buy you one sweetie?” My mother had arrived.

“How much for a skewer?”

“That’ll be three coppers for one.” 

I felt my eyebrows scrunch together as I held the skewer in my hand. Did the toady vendor really lie? Like he said, who decided what was a lie? The golden circle had to be some form of magic. This was too confusing.

Taking my first bite of the skewer filled me with amazement. A bit gamey, but that  only added to the charm. The temple didn’t have that much meat to eat and this tasted different from the dishes Victoria made. 

“Is this meat from the four-eyed deer monster?” I asked her

“You can’t really eat monsters, sweetie.”

“Why not?” I took another cube of meat  into my mouth.

“Monsters were poisoned by the goddess to make it so we wouldn't needlessly hunt them.”

“Really?” I put the last cube in my mouth. “Wouldn’t it be better to hunt them for food?”

“Who knows? Maybe we can ask one of the priests at the church.”

She went on to explain that the church in town was the place to ask about the goddess, the divine or anything monster related. A church didn’t sound like a place where I would be comfortable at. It’s a wonder how I managed to even stay at a temple.

With two empty skewers in one hand, and my mother’s hand in the other, I accompanied her wherever she led me. The sight of the town was quite something. It looked just like a medieval city. Cobblestones laid on our path and carriages with horses could be seen going up and down the streets, clipping and clopping all the while. Passing a bunch of people, we arrived in front of a shop.

The town was pretty developed for being a town on the outskirts, Gale said. There was a social class system used in the Kingdom where the aristocracy held more power than the commoners. At the top of the social pyramid stood the King, he could have ruled the kingdom with an iron fist doing whatever he wanted, hadn't it been for the nobles. The highest ranking nobles were the three dukes who, with the help of several different aristocratic factions, held the king and each other in check. Gale had let out a huge sigh when he had explained.

The noble ruling over this town was Baron Barre, which was also the name of the town. Barre of the Guillain Kingdom. It rolled nicely off the tongue. Gale didn’t seem that happy when talking about him.

“Why don’t you wait on the bench here?” She pointed to a bench set outside the store, shaded by a big leafy tree.

My legs had begun to ache so it was a welcome offer. Sitting on the bench and watching the people walking past me was entertaining enough. There were some guards walking around with spears in their hand patrolling the area, people who were haggling with vendors trying to get the most for their money, I should try doing that next time. Yet what had been the most entertaining was the striking hair colors of the people in this town. Red, blue, green, a bunch of colors littered the heads of the passerbys. Speaking of, a boy with red hair had appeared in front of me.

“What’s a young lady like you doing here? Never seen you here before.”

A young lady, wasn’t that usually used when talking to nobles? Well I did wear a rather pretty dress and fancy sunhat. Victoria had given me one of hers to protect me from the scorching summer sun. Anyway, who is he?

The boy had a tall frame with tanned skin, evidence of him having played outside a lot. He still had some boyness to him as his face didn’t look like a man yet. His green eyes stared at me and his unkempt red hair looked like a hedgehog I had seen once.

“I’m not a young lady, my name is Esther. I’ve never seen you before either”

“Is that so? I’m Eric, I live in that house over there”, he said, pointing at the house next to the shop. “I’m 14”

Is this how you are supposed to introduce yourself?

“I live outside town, I’m 13”

He smirked. “Looks like I’m older than you”

“Are you lost or something?” 

“I’m waiting for my mom.”

“That sounds boring.” The boy took a seat beside me as if it was natural, plopping himself down. He was a whole head higher than me.

“Yeah this is boring, wanna go play instead?” It hadn’t even been a full minute before he said something. 

“My mother said to not go with strangers.” 

Victoria didn’t tell me this but the point still stands, I think. *She* didn't really exude a sense of confidence. Besides, playing? That did sound fun.

“I’m not a stranger, I know your name and you know mine. Oh I know.” He rummaged through his bag, eventually pulling something wrapped in paper.

“My dad told me to give a gift to someone to make them your friend. Here take one”

It was hard-candy. I hadn’t had sugar in a while, it was supposed to be pretty rare so how did this kid get some? Not passing up this opportunity, I unwrapped one and popped it into my mouth. My mouth felt like it was burning as the sweetness enveloped my mouth. 

He smiled. “There, we’re now friends”

“Is that how that works?” I snuck another piece into my mouth.

“Hey, don't take all of them\!” Tsk, he took them away.

“Don’t click your tongue at me…”

“Who’s this, Esther? A new friend?” My mother was finished with her shopping.

“Yeah, he gave me some candy".

“Did he now? Well thank you for that”. Victoria gave him a smile.

“O-oh it was no problem, my lady. My name is Eric. I live over there”. He was already on his feet, his face turning red like his hair.

“Oh my\! My lady?” She looked happy.

He had a dumb expression on his face. “Mom, can I go play with Eric for a bit?”

“Hmm” She turned to look at the guards. “Make sure to meet us by the fountain on the next bell, okay? Eric, can I offer you this mission?”

“Of course\!”

“Eric, let's go.”

“Huh? Oh, sure”

Eric went after me after giving my mother a farewell. I saw that she was waving at us when I turned around. My cheeks filled with air as I walked a little bit faster. 

“Hey where are you going, that’s the wrong way”

“Really? I don’t even know where I am going.”

“Weirdo.” Eric gave me a funny look. “This way. All the kids play over there.”

Snaking around some alleys and streets, we arrived into a clearing, where a group of kids were chatting and running around.

“Hey guys\! A brought another one to play with”

“Eric\!” a girl in shorts came running up to us. “I told you to stop bringing over random kids\!”, she said grumpily.

“She’s not some random kid, I befriended her with some candy. Isn’t that fine? She looked pretty bored so I took her along.” Rubbing his nose, it looked like he thought he did something heroic. I wasn’t actually bored.

“That’s not the correct way to befriend someone\!” She sounded exasperated. 

The girl let out a sigh. “Ugh, well what’s done is done. I’m Karrie by the way”. 

My sunhat was blocking me from seeing her face. Tilting my head to move it out of the way, a sight I had not expected greeted me.

“What? What are you doing here?” 

“Ann?”

“Who’s that, I said my name was Karrie.”

“You know her?” Eric asked.

“She’s my neighbor. Did you get sick again? Haven’t seen you around lately.”

Chestnut-brown hair done in a short bob, a pair of brown eyes and above them, two thin eyebrows framing her round face. A vivid image of her laying in a casket filled my head. There was no mistaking it, she had a different name but this was definitely her. 

“Hello? You home?” A hand appeared in front of me, waving back and forth.

“Oh, sorry. Nice to meet you, I’m Esther. I live outside of town”. 

“What kind of greeting is that supposed to be? And I already know who you are.” Tilting her head to the side. Her eyebrows seemed to question me. “Is this some kind of a new joke?”

“Sorry it wasn’t a joke. I lost my memories a few days ago, so I don't remember anyone.”

“Are you joking? How’s that possible”

“I don’t know, the priest said he didn’t know either.”

“You called a priest? Must have been serious then…” She crossed her arms.

“Whoah, that's so cool\!” Jumping into the conversation was a cheerful looking Eric.

“So you don’t remember anything?” I nodded to his question.

“What about your parents, did you remember them?”

“Hey\! What are you saying\!” Seeing her slap Eric on the back resurfaced some old memories. 

“When I woke up, I just saw this pretty lady looking at me.” 

“Yeah that’s right, she’s really pretty\!”. Eric said, rubbing his back. Tsk.

“Hey, stop clicking your tongue at me\! What did I do now?”

Eric continued. “Well? And then what happened?”

“Hey quit it, look how sad she is getting\!”

Sad? Me? Well this works out. The golden magic circle thingy had nagged at me and with Ann popping up, I could investigate them both.

“Ann, do you know what happened on Earth?”

She was silent, only looking at me. 

Her mouth finally opened. “Oh.” Was she also reincarnated? “You were talking to me? I don’t know this erf thing you are talking about, but my name is Karrie.”

No magic circle appeared. How could this be? She was definitely Ann. I couldn’t forget her face even if I wanted to. 

“Are we going to play or what?” Eric said.

“Ah, that’s right, let's do something fun\!” Ann- Karrie said.

“We? You gonna ditch the others?”

“They only do tiring stuff, the weather is too hot today. I don’t want to get sweaty. You know anything interesting to do, Esther?” Right the circle must not be detecting lies after all.

“Esther? Hello?” 

“Oh, sorry, I don’t remember.”

“Wow… I bet you say that often.” Eric said incredulously. Karrie glanced at me and nodded.

Ridiculous as it sounds, it was the truth, or more correctly, I didn’t know any games. Having never had the chance to play with others, remembering games or fun things to do was just wasted energy I could instead use to survive. Well, there was one activity I was often a part of.  

“How about truth or dare?” I spat out.

“You serious?” They said in tandem.

“It was a joke”, was what I wanted to say as an excuse, however before I could let out the words exit my mouth, a golden magic circle had formed in front of it, blocking me from speaking.

She really wasn’t Ann?

# Chapter 4: Truth or Dare

“Well I see you still make bad jokes…” She sighed.

“That sounds fun, let's try it\!” Eric agreed to the game I said on impulse. “Maybe we can help her remember things.”

“And what if she only chooses dare?”

“I didn’t think that far…”

The magic circle had dissipated. It had slowly faded into the air into nothingness, letting me speak again. I didn’t really want to play this game, it was never fun, but I figured I could use this opportunity to investigate whether that was Ann or not. She wouldn’t be able to figure out who I am, my face and body was completely different. I don’t think I even need to lie or tell the truth this time.

“Let’s play truth or dare then.”

Eric nodded. “Yes\! You can start, Esther, since you were the one who chose it.”

I turned to Karrie. “Truth or dare.” She picked ‘truth’.

“Is it true that your favorite color is red?” 

“Yes, how did you know?” I shrugged. There was no golden circle this time.

“Okay, my turn. Eric, truth or dare?” 

“I will pick dare of course.” He looked confident.

“I dare you to climb that tree over there, give me a leaf.” The tree she pointed at was at least two stories high. 

“Pfft\! That’s easy\!” Eric stood in front of the tree, its width as high as he was tall. He climbed the tree as fast as he went down, holding a big leaf in his hand.

“Here you go.” He handed the leaf to an open-mouthed Karrie.

“What\! How did you do that\! That was so fast\!” She bounced up and down excitedly.

“Hmm hmm, I’m the fastest in this town you know?” Eric puffed out his chest as Karrie and I showered him with praises. Then he picked me to choose ‘truth or dare’. I picked ‘truth’ of course, my body was getting sore.

“Whats your mother’s favorite food?” Her favorite food that’s easy. Carrot stew.

“...\!” What? Why did it show up?

“\!\!\!”

“You don’t remember? I didn’t know it was that bad…”

“No wait, it’s …” No way.

“Esther, you shouldn’t push yourself that hard.” Karrie seemed concerned. Why would *she* look concerned? 

“I know it\! I just can’t say it\!

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I tried to say something else but it didn’t let me. It just blocked my mouth and dazzled. The thing couldn’t even be touched.

I heard them whisper. “Eric, maybe we should change games, she looks really angry…”

“Yeah…” Why were they whispering?

“Esther, how about we play something else?” I see how it is, just because I can’t answer your stupid questions you want to change the game?

“No\! I want to play truth or dare\!” You were always like this.

“Uhm, how about we change the question then, Eric can you-”

“Why should he change his question\! Stop getting in my way\!”

“Esther, I changed my question.”

“Shut up\! The answer is—”

“What is your favorite food”

“—carrot soup\!” What? 

Only the background noise of rustling trees and kids playing could be heard as I tried to understand what had just happened. They just stood there.

“What? My favorite food is carrot soup?” 

“Eshter, are you really okay? I know you always get sick but maybe you should rest for a bit?”

“Okay…” Karrie was looking at me just like Victoria did and Eric hadn’t said anything ever since I yelled out my favorite food. I dragged my body toward the tree Eric had climbed, and took a seat in its shadow. It was cold. I hugged my knees to try to warm up a bit.

The two of them ended up playing with the other kids for a while, before coming back to check up on me. Eric had offered another piece of candy to which I accepted, however it didn’t taste that sweet this time, it was just, sour.

“Do you want to play rock paper scissors?” Karrie suggested. 

I must have really looked terrible if we had to resort to playing that. She bounced her hand two times and on the third bounce, I threw out scissors. 

“I win.” Karrie had thrown out paper, she always did that.

“Let me join the next round.” Eric smiled again.

We sat under the tree and played a couple more rounds. Throwing out my hand this much had warmed up my body a bit. The bell rang in the distance as I noticed the sun hanging a little lower than it did before. 

“Aw shucks, I lost” Eric threw himself down on the grass, laying on his back.”

“You’re really good at this Esther. It was like you already knew what we were going to throw.” Karrie said. 

“Are you saying I know magic?” Eric didn’t have a poker face and I already knew Karrie’s thought pattern. “You guys sound like sore losers.” 

“You know magic?” Eric said from below, ignoring that last part.

“I don’t think I do. How can you check?”

“You just know it?” I thought back on the dozen golden circles. Was that magic? 

“A priest should know if they use their magic on you.”

“Can I be healed if I have magic?”

“Of course you can”, Karrie said. “Healing magic works on everyone, I heard your body shines in your favorite color if you have the ability to use magic\!”

“But nothing has shined from my body yet…” She drooped her shoulders.

“You know a lot about magic, Karrie. Did you want to be one?” Eric looked at her.

“Of course\! Who wouldn’t want to be a cool mage.”

“I would rather be a knight.”

“That’s because you are stupid.”

He flew up from the ground. “I’m not stupid\!”

“Yes you are\! That's why she won\!”

While they were having their little squabble, the other kids had already wrapped up their games and left the plaza. I began to also leave, dragging my feet toward the meeting point Victoria had told me. I missed her. The two others began following me as I approached the alleys, they all looked the same. 

“Esther”, Eric called out.

“What is it?”

“Thats the wrong way. The fountain is this way.” I saw him smirk.

“Oh, I thought you were taking a shortcut, Esther. So sorry.” My cheeks felt hot as I turned and followed them instead.

With Eric leading the way, the three of us began our journey through the alleys. Chatting along the way were the two of them, their topics ranged from this to that. Occasionally, I gave an affirmative “Yes” or “I see” pretending to listen as I focused all my strength in my feet instead. They were beginning to hurt.

“Hey did you hear about the Executioner? How dead people keep popping up?” I turned my ears towards Eric.

“I did see that there were more guards than usual lately, is that why?” 

“Finn said that his dad would give a huge reward to the person that caught him.” 

“Really? Why doesn’t he just catch them himself? Isn’t he the captain?” Karrie put her hand to her chin. “How much are we talking about?”

“He said thirty gold coins\!” Eric gestured with his hands.

“Oh my goddess.” Was that a huge sum? “And you really believed him?”

“Well…”

She shrugged. “I can’t remember the last time that daddy’s boy said something that was true.”

“You do have a point.” He copied Karrie’s hand gesture.

The fountain came into view as we rounded the corner. Victoria was already there with Gale, the two of them talking to a woman. She wore pants, which I hadn’t seen a woman use in a while, and a big cape. Her light blue hair was also cut short, only reaching her chin. She looked pretty with that unusual hairdo.

“Miss Victoria\!” Karrie shouted. “We brought Esther back”

Having heard her name being called, she turned toward us three. She smiled when her gaze met mine. I could hear Eric mumble my mothers name in front of me. Tsk.

“Goodness, there’s a whole group of you now.” 

“Oh my, how cute. Are these all your children?” The short haired woman asked.

“As if, one is more than enough for us.” Gale crouched down, meeting me at my eye level. “Did you make new friends already today?”

“Yeah, this is Eric and Karrie. But I think Karrie was already my friend.”

The woman looked at me and then at my mother. “The resemblance is uncanny. Nice to meet you, I’m Raviel.” She gave me a bow. 

“Hello, I’m Esther, I live out of town. I’m thirteen.” I bowed back, which got a chuckle out of her. Was there something funny?

“I suppose it is time for the children to head back, should we meet again to finalize the contract?” Gale confirmed and Raviel left us, blending through the crowd of people.

“Aw shucks, I’m gonna get scolded again\! Bye guys, and see you Lady Victoria\!” Eric left while waving toward my mother.

“Lady Victoria? Did that boy just..?” Yes he did, Gale.

My mother waved back. “What a charming boy.” 

“Karrie, did you go out alone again? Do you want to head back with us today?” Karrie glanced shyly at my mother and nodded.

With Karrie and I at the front, we began our journey back home. It was amazing how much Karrie could talk. My ear nearly fell off, still at least she looked happy chatting away. If only she could hear my inner turmoil.

Was Ann or Karrie? She wasn’t Ann at the moment, yet her face was. It was fun playing with them today, I had a good time. *It wouldn’t hurt to just observe her*. Her mouth was opening and closing rapidly, letting the words flow out.

We finally arrived at her house. It looked similar to ours, which stood there in the distance, even the tree in the backyard stood in a similar position.

“See ya Esther\! I will definitely win next time, let’s play again\!”

My parents said farewell to her mother, who had come outside to scold her tomboy daughter. They seemed to know each other well, promising to visit should there be time for it. 

“Was she one of those people who had that idea you were talking about?”

He adjusted the grip on the bag of stuff. “Raviel?” Gale explained that Raviel’s employer had apparently found a treasure map of some kind and needed some experienced people that knew the lay of the land. He boasted that no one knew this place better than him. The employer had apparently found him because of this boasting. 

I don’t know about this idea of hers, doesn’t it sound suspicious? Such a high sum just to guide some people…”

“That’s just how they are. How about this?” He took her hand. “I will tell my men to immediately run should I sense anything dangerous. This job is too lucrative to give up.” He planted a kiss on the back of her hand. 

“I’m really sorry for making you always do all this work…”

“Nothing to be sorry about, I married you didn’t I?” I saw my mother blush while the red evening sun shone behind her.

Getting tucked in by my mother became a routine of sorts after I moved rooms. Although it still felt awkward as I laid there, hiding half of my face under the blanket, while she looked over me.

“Did you have fun today?” I nodded.

I had made a commotion when my legs suddenly gave out and Gale had to carry me the rest of the way. She had fretted around the house blaming herself for not taking better care of me. It wasn’t until her husband comforted her saying that none of it was her fault. A child had to fall down to learn how to pick themself up, he said. My mother patted my belly as she sat there with a gentle expression. 

“I played truth or dare today.”

“Really?”

“But it wasn't any fun… So we played rock paper scissors instead.” My eyes felt heavier as Victoria kept patting my belly. 

“I won, they didn’t even have a chance.”

“Of course my daughter won. Why, she must be the best at rock paper scissors in the world.” She gave my forehead a kiss.

Her mood always changed whenever something happened to me. Happy when she saw that I finished my meal. Sad when I looked exhausted from moving around. It was apparent even to me how much she loved her daughter. I wonder what I have to do to not make her make that sad expression anymore.

She left the room when I could no longer open my eyes. A lot had happened today. I ate grilled meat, stole– ate some candy Eric had given me, and met Karrie. It was honestly shocking seeing her but she was fun to be around. It had been a long time since I've had fun with others. 

A sudden realization shook off my drowsiness as I opened my eyes wide. Laying on top of my desk was my coin pouch, it still had a silver coin in it. I forgot to spend my money\! Tomorrow, I would spend some money tomorrow, whatever it took.

# Chapter 5: Church

Sitting on the prayer bench, my eyes lost its focus staring at the hand-crafted marble statue. The sides of my dress had become wrinkled by how hard I clenched my hands. Today was the day of the Goddess, the seventh day of the week. 

I had my whole day planned out. First, wear something comfortable. After that, go to town, maybe with Karrie if she wanted to and then use the whole day to go find something interesting to spend my money on. My mother had woken me up as usual, however this morning she told me to get ready for church. I glanced up at the statue of the goddess with her smug expression.

The sight of statues was starting to really annoy me. Did they all really need to make the same face? Why can’t they just be faceless or have a mask on. At least make their eyes closed. The sunlight shone through the stained glass window, draping its colors across the hall. I sat where the red light shone, the perfect spot for the statue to look down at me. My dress would get ripped if I didn’t control myself.

“And onto us the Goddess bestowed these five commands\!” The headpriest doing the sermon shouted something familiar. He was a middle aged man wearing an all white garment, the only other color being the golden scarf thing. A stole I think it was called.

He went on to explain the five rules one had to follow to not be damned: Killing, theft, adultery, lying, and intoxication. What? It was the same as the five precepts the monks used to tell me. Wasn’t it a unique concept? I thought back to what the monks had said to me once.  

“Do you know why drinking is the last thing to be mentioned? That’s because it’s the most important one.” The monk said.

“Why isn’t killing the worst thing? That would make more sense.” 

“Hmm, let me tell you a story then.

There once was a young monk going around begging for food. This was a task assigned by his master as a form of study. It wasn’t a simple task to beg for food. Knocking on the doors of houses, silence would greet him more often than not. 

One time, someone had given the monk a jug of wine, they had no water to give. The monk had never taken a sip of alcohol before, he had been raised in the temple. Feeling thirsty, he took a sip, and then a glug, and finally the whole jug was gone. He felt full.

Walking down the street he was getting hungry from drinking. The young monk spotted a plump chicken in someone’s backyard. Passing through the fence, he took the chicken and slaughtered it. There was a coal grill in the backyard and so he began grilling it. He felt full.

The houseowner heard the commotion in their backyard and angrily yelled at the monk for stealing her chicken. The monk had never seen such a beautiful woman before in his life, and before he knew it, he had committed adultery. He felt full.

Returning back to his temple, the master asked him if he had done something other than go beg for food. No, he replied. The master looked upon the young monk. He felt full of sadness.

“How about it? Do you see why it is mentioned last? A drunk person will easily lose reason and do whatever their inner instincts tell them to do.”

“I don’t know. Would some alcohol really make someone do all that?”

The monk chuckled. “You may still be a bit too young to understand”

\*\*\*

“May you all be blessed\!” The booming voice snapped me out of my thoughts. The sermon had ended and the dozens of people started streaming out of the church. I followed my parents the opposite way.

“What a surprise to see you here today, Mr. Gale. Did something good happen?” The headpriest smiled.

I noticed Gale clench his fist. “Good to see you too, Father.” A big golden circle appeared. I turned to see if the priest saw it, no reaction. 

“We were wondering if we could meet with the priest who paid us a visit a few days ago?”

“Straight to the core of the matter as always.” The priest closed the holy book slowly, not making a sound, then with quiet steps, sauntered around the altar. 

“What’s with the hastiness? How about we chat over a cup of tea?” He motioned to the door at the back. 

“Thank you for the offer, but we don’t want to take up more of your time than necessary”

The priest stood still for a moment, still smiling. “What a shame I just got these new tea leaves, it's not often you get things from the capital here you know?” He paused for a second. 

“You must be talking about Father Lawrence who joined us recently, speaking of which, he consulted with me on an interesting matter of his.” He turned and stared at me. His jovial expression still plastered on his face. 

“Hmm, I see.”

I noticed something gold flicker in his eyes as Gale stepped forward, blocking his sight. 

“Sorry about, a force of habit”. He pulled out a bag from the altar. “Do you want some raisins?”

“No thanks”, I said.

“Like father, like daughter.” He chuckled to himself.

“Well, then. He should be in the library.” The priest opened the door, motioning us to follow.

“He is still unpleasant as ever.” He sighed. “This won’t take long.” Gale left, leaving my mother and I behind.

My mother bent down to talk to me. “Want to go visit the courtyard? I heard they got some new pretty flowers\!”

The smell of flowers tickled my nose as I strolled around the courtyard holding my mothers hand. Roses the size of my hand and other flowers in all kinds of colors lit up the well-trodden path. 

“I wonder if we could take some home with us”, she studied the peonies, “don’t you think it would spruce up our home, Esther?”

I nodded. A golden circle had appeared before my mouth. I hated flowers. I couldn’t care less about them. They cost too much and their fragrant smell made me feel sick. I had seen enough of them already. Maybe I should ask the priest if he knew something about this annoying thing.

We sat on a bench after my mother was done with her flower-gazing. The gray church stood like a castle in the courtyard.

I turned to Victoria “Mom, would you rather I had my memories back?”

“What are you talking about sweetie?” She furrowed her brows.

“Isn’t that why we are at the church? To ask for a cure?”

“Well…” She took a moment to say the next words. “You know we will always love you, right?”

I nodded.

“We just felt that you may be a bit frustrated not knowing all the things your father and I are talking about.”

“I’m not.” I turned away from her gaze. “It’s kinda fun learning new things everyday”.

I didn’t need to look to figure out what expression she had, she had wrapped her arms around me and gave me a hug.

“Esther\!” Someone shouted my name.

“Let’s play\!” It was Karrie, wearing a dress this time. Her pale shoulders peeked above her dress. I got permission to play for a bit and went over to where Karrie was waving. 

“Are you still getting hugs at your age?” 

“What’s wrong with that, I like them.”

“Wow… Gross…” She rubbed her shoulders. “I can’t believe how different you are now…”

“Really, how did I act before?”

“Uhm”, she hesitated, “it didn’t look like you liked you mom that much”

“That’s ridiculous, was I stupid or something?”

“Yeah, I thought so too\! Your mom is ten times nicer than mine.”

Karrie told me more things about Esther, how she behaved, how she talked, and how she never looked to really have fun whenever she played, always having a sad or tired expression on her face. Karrie seemed to like this version of Esther a lot more.

“Hey, let's go find some cool insects.”

“Insects? How do you find them?”

“Oh right, you just need to find a really big rock and lift it.” She motioned with her hands. “I saw some really big ones behind the church\!”

Following her, I turned around and looked at my mother. Her hair was gently swaying in the cool wind and she had her eyes closed with a peaceful expression. I should let her sleep some more.

“This one will do.” Karrie gripped a decently sized rock and turned it over. Dozens of insects scrawled around as their roof had disappeared. A big worm squirmed there on the dirt. It twirled and twirled as if trying to become a ball before deciding to rather be a stick. It was disgusting. Why don’t you just dig in the dirt if you’re getting burned by the sun? You incompetent worm. I’m glad I didn’t reincarnate into this stupid thing. 

I grabbed a nearby stick and stabbed it in its thick part. It went unscathed, my stick only pressing it into the dirt helping it find cover from the sun. I stabbed it again and again. There was a small hole where it had squirmed. It had disappeared. I couldn’t even kill this single insignificant worm. 

“Whoah, look at that beetle\!”

The outside rushed back into my senses. Karrie pointed with a stick at a beetle.

“I bet ya it will stink twice as much”, she said chirpily before upturning rock after rock, looking for an even bigger beetle. I didn’t see how she could enjoy herself.

“What are you dumb girls doing?” Someone interrupted our playing.

Strutting toward us was a tall moss-headed boy and another boy trailing behind him.

“Ugh, it’s Finn and his lackey”

“Who’s that?”

“Someone annoying, just ignore them.” She turned away from them.

“Hey\! I asked you a question\!” Moss-boy demanded

The other boy spoke up. “Bro, why are we even talking to them? Let’s go find some cool sticks\!”

“I don’t care about some dumb sticks\!” He suddenly roared. 

“But you said-” Finn threw his hand over the other boy’s mouth.

Karrie sighed. “What do you want?” Her voice contrasted her earlier cheery tone. 

“You\!” The green boy pointed at her. “Why are you hanging out with Esther?”

“It’s nonya”

“What’s nonya?” The other boy asked.

“None of ya business\!” Karrie guffawed.

“Thats not funny\!” 

Crossing his arms he turned to me. “Esther, you shouldn’t hang out with her.” Who was he to tell me what to do?

“Why not?”

“She’s a bad person\! Don’t you remember how she spread the rumours?”

“What rumours?” 

“Hey\!-” Karrie tried to interrupt him. 

“That you are always pretending\!”

“Stop\!”

“That the only reason we play with you is because you are pretty\!”

I looked toward Karrie, he had spoken the truth.

“Esther, I didn’t really mean to-”

“Yeah right.” Finn interrupted. “You are only pretending to hang out with her aren’t you. You probably have some other evil plan to make Esther sad again. You are a bad person, Karrie.” Karrie looked like a beaten up puppy as he barraged her with comments. He looked proud. That image irritated me, she was my friend.

“You shouldn’t hang out with those types of people.” He reached his hand toward me. 

“I didn’t believe those rumours at all you know?” He lied. 

“You should hang out with someone with a good personality like me instead” His cheeks reddened a little as he said that. 

Is that how it works? He didn’t look like a person with a good personality. Actually, in the short time I saw and heard him, I thought the opposite to be true.

“No thanks.” I said flatly. Finn’s hand dropped a little. “I’d rather play with Karrie.”

“What? Why?” 

“Because you are stupid, and your personality sucks.” Finn and the boy looked shocked. 

“What? Esther, I’m trying to help you out here\!”

“Yeah, Finn is the smartest out of all of us\!” The other stupid boy said stupidly.

“Why are you getting angry? I should be angry at you for even talking to me.”

“Esther…” Karrie said meekly.

“I’m not getting angry\!” The circle dazzled. “My dad said getting angry is only for weak people\!”

“Is that right, then you must be both angry and stupid. And your dad must be stupid too\!” I felt my blood rushing in my veins.

“Don’t call my dad stupid\!” My vision yanked upward towards the sky. The front of my shoulders hurt but the impact on the back of my head made that seem small in comparison. He had shoved me to the ground. 

“Hey\! Why did you do that\!”

“I-I didn’t mean to\!”

“Bro, let's just get out of here\!” 

They scurried away while I grabbed my head. I’ve had enough. Everything irritated me. Irritating statues, irritating gold circles, and irritating people. 

I turned to Karrie standing above me. She was shouting at them. “You cowards\! Why are you running\! Come back here\!”

“Karrie.”

“Oh, Esther, are you okay?” She had a conflicted expression on her face as she helped me up.

“I’m really sorry…” 

“Why are you sorry? They should be the ones saying sorry.” My voice growled.

“It’s my fault you got pushed… and I said those things about you…”

I stared into her downcast eyes. “Karrie, the truth is, I’m not the real Esther. So you don’t need to feel guilty for what you said about her.”

Karrie’s eyes blew up like a pair of plates.

“What?” She looked shocked. 

“What a bad joke…”

# Chapter 6: A corpse

I felt like this situation had happened before.  

“It’s not a joke.” I felt the wind in my sails disappear a little.

Karrie took a deep breath. “Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Esther, but I did really say those things about you…” she scrunched her nose.

“The truth is, I’ve always wanted to be friends with you, but it was hard to talk to you…” She bowed her head. “I want to apologize\!”

The wind disappeared completely. I stood frozen as I stared at the top of her head. Being on the receiving end of an apology was weird. I had always been me on the other side. Her hair rustled in the cool summer wind.

“Ugh, this is so embarrassing\!” Karrie lifted her head, her cheeks red like beets. “Just say whether you accept it or not\!”  

“Oh. Sorry, I accept your apology.” Was that how you did it?

“No\! Now it just sounds like I forced you\!” Karrie seemed to struggle with something as she hid her face behind her hands.

I stared at her face. “It’s fine Karrie. I want to be friends with you too”

“Really?” She peeked between her fingers. “Even when I said those things about you?”

“Don’t worry about it, you didn’t talk about me”

“Yeah right…”

“More importantly, where does Finn live?”

Karrie opened her eyes wide. “Why? Are you going to demand an apology? No chance.”

“What are you talking about, I just don’t want his stupidity spreading to me. I need to know where he lives to do that.”

Karrie let out a chuckle, joining me in throwing insults at him, before telling me what his address was.

“I see”, I gave her the biggest smile I could muster. “Thanks”.

\*\*\*  
The sound of metal being hit by hammers could be heard piercing through the background noise containing the clinking of the armored people, and the chatter of people promoting their wares. Black smoke bloomed atop the chimneys of the blacksmiths making the air feel a little stifling.

“This ain’t no place for a younging like you to go play around”. A sooty old man said to me. “Where are you parents, kid”.

The shop was filled to the brim with weapons and armors, all laid messily in crates or barrels, except for a few hanging on the wall or in display cases. 

“Did you make all the knives yourself?” They looked really well made lying there on display.

The man crossed his arms. “Knives? Never have I ever– these are *daggers.*”

I tilted my head. “What’s the difference?” 

Looking exasperated, he staggered around the counter to face me. I had to crane my neck to look at him. 

“The difference, young lady, is that daggers are used for killing things”. Picking up one of the *daggers,* he took a few stabs at the air.

“I see.”

“Understood? Now go along, before you hurt yourself–”

“How much for this one?” I pointed to a simple looking dagger.

He frowned. “Didn’t you hear me? These are for killing things.” He looked me up and down. 

He gave me a new glance, looking me up and down. I stared back.

“Two gold coins” No golden circle, it was the correct price.

I opened the bag Victoria had bought for me. It looked like a pocketbook.  

“Do you have anything for one silver?”

He clicked his tongue. “Check that pile over there, rejects, the lot of them.”

The box was piled in the dozens with either bent products or half-finished projects.  

“Made ‘em in my apprentice days”

“Must be really old then.” I remarked.

“I see you got humour in you, kid.”

He picked the most decent thing out for me. It was a dagger made of a single piece of metal, it looked like a big toothpick. 

Holding it in my hand I gave it a few swings and stabs. The old man let out an impressed whistle seeing my movements. The dagger felt good in my hand. This would do.

“You seem to really like it.” He appeared to be enjoying himself.

I tried giving him my silver coin but he stopped me, shooing me with his hand. 

“Take it, it’s just scrap metal to me. I don’t know what a young girl like you needs with a dagger, just make sure to not get hurt.” 

He wasn’t as grumpy as I thought. Putting the dagger in my pocketbook, I gave him a curtsy I learnt from Victoria and went on my merry way. Karrie was waiting for me at the end of the street. 

Our family had met up with hers at the church and suggested having a bite together in town. While the adults talked about adult things, Karrie and I scurried off together to look at cool things. 

“I don’t get why you wanted to look around here, Esther. It’s so noisy and it stinks.” 

She turned to her left. “And why are you here?”

“You guys looked to do something fun\!” Eric had spotted us walking around. 

“All’s fun with you isn't it?” She let out a sigh. “Are you done with this place, Esther?”

I nodded.

“Nice\! Let’s go check out that huge crowd over there\! I heard even the Baron has come\!” Eric said excitedly. 

Dragging us along, he told us about the killer that had been terrorising the townspeople for the past few weeks. Whenever there was a gathering of guards, it would mean a body had popped up. The people were starting to get used to it. A green haired, in better armor than the other guards, could be seen directing the others. He must be Finn’s father.

The guards had linked together to make a semi-circle around the point of interest, barring all entry to the onlookers. There was a man kneeling on the ground surrounded by flowers, he seemed to be a farmer judging by his clothes. His back sat straight as he cradled the object in his arms; it stared at me. A pair of open lifeless eyes stared at me. Where his head should have been, stood only a neck stump. A flower had been pressed down his throat. A white lily, stained with drops of blood. The man had been decapitated and displayed like a piece of art. It was pretty.

“How horrible…” A woman from the crowd gasped.

“Tsk, of course it's another one of us.” Another shabbily dressed man spat.

“Goddess, please protect us from this demon\!” An old woman broke out into prayer, mirroring the decapitated man. The blood had pooled on the rough cobblestones underneath, making me wonder if the roses were originally white or red. It painted a picturesque scene. It looked almost religious. 

Covering my face in my hands, I could feel the corners of my face twitch.

“Eric, I’m about to puke… Why did you bring us here?” Karrie’s face was white like a sweet piece of marshmallow. I imagined squeezing her soft face. 

“I thought it would be cool…” Why are you biting your lips Eric? This is cool\! You don’t need to frown okay? 

“You okay Esther?” She patted my back as I stood there hiding my face. 

Sorry Ann, I don’t want to see your face right now. And I don’t want you to see mine either. I crouched down to hide myself. 

“My lord\! We have to hire more guards\!” The mossy man talked to the chubby man.

“Uhm, aren’t there enough of you? The finances were a little tight right now…” Oh, Mr. Baron, why are you lying? 

“Enough of us?\! This has been the fourth time The Executioner has struck you know\!”

“How is that my problem? You are the captain of the guards, just go arrest the damned man.” 

“And how are we supposed to do that with only thirty of us\!”

“That sounds like a lot to me.”

Murmurs could be heard from the crowd but I couldn’t focus.

“Eric, I don’t think Esther should be here any longer, we should go back.”

“Yeah, sorry…”

\*\*\*

“Hello kids, you look like you’ve seen a ghost or something\!” Karrie’s father guffawed. 

“Uh, yeah, ha ha.” Eric replied.

Sitting around the table were our parents chatting away. 

“What happened?” Victoria asked us. 

Seeing that Karrie and Eric didn’t have anything to say, I spoke up. “Do ghosts really exist?”

“‘Course they do\! Why, I saw one myself this one time\!” He was loud, but surprisingly truthful.

His wife let out a sigh. “There he goes again…” 

“Come sit with me, Esther.” Victoria picked me up and put me on her lap. Karrie looked to be envious of me. 

“Oh, yeah?” Gale asked. “And then what did you do?”

“What did I do? Well I ran of course.”

His wife let out another sigh. “I don’t understand why you are telling other people about your cowardice…”

“Nonsense\! It’s not cowardice, it's called being smart. Think”, he tapped his head with a finger, “how am I supposed to beat up a ghost? I don't even know how to use magic\!” He looked proud as he pointed his nose in the air.

“Speaking of, what happened to that job of yours?”

“Ugh, don’t even mention it.” Gale leant back into his chair crossing his arms. “They suddenly cancelled it, saying some nonsense about it being too dangerous and we weren’t the right fit.

“Hah, if you’re not the right fit then I wonder who is?”

“Right? Although it’s getting worrisome how this isn’t the first time the job’s been cancelled. Gale threw his hand in the air. “What must one do to get a decent paying job around here?”

Victoria fed me one of the bits of food on the table, it was tasty. “I’m just glad nothing dangerous happened”. Eric and Karrie looked stupid sitting there.

“It did sound suspicious." Karrie’s mother remarked. “I tell you, all men must think they are invincible.”  

“It adds to their charm don’t you think?” She covered her pretty mouth as she gave out a small laugh. 

“It’s a wonder how you two are still in your honeymoon phase…” She glanced at her husband. He shrugged.

“Maybe they got scared off by the Executioner?” He said. Oh, they both flinched at the same time upon hearing the moniker.

“What a horrid name, they still haven’t catched them?” Gale replied.

“Well, you know how our lord likes to do things” He pointed his chin towards where the Barons manor stood.

Clicking his tongue, Gale chugged down the rest of his cup. “They always prioritise the wrong things, those nobles. What happened to noblesse oblige?”

“That nobles had the duty to protect us commoners? Ha, you really believe in that nonsense?”

The four adults continued to chat with each other until it was time to head home. Eric promised to do something more fun next time and apologized to Karrie and I. Karrie gave him a smack on his back, telling him it was fine. And me? I didn’t mind, I had better things to think about. 

Tonight. Tonight? *Tonight.*

# Chapter 7: Finn

Hearing something plink at his window, Finn woke up after the third time it happened. With heavyset feet, he shuffled to the window, opening it. He thought it was one of the boys always hanging out with him. Instead, under his window stood someone wholly unexpected. It was Esther. Her golden hair glistened in the moonlight. She was about to throw another pebble until she noticed him.

“Ah, there you are." She said cheerfully.

“Esther? What are you doing here?” It was in the middle of the night.

“Come down, I want to talk with you”

“Right now?” Finn had also wanted to talk to her. He didn’t mean to shove her and wanted to apologise, his father said that a man had to do that if they hurt a woman. 

“Give me a second.” He whispered loudly.

What did she want to talk about? Did she finally get hurt by that girl again? That must be it. She had acted like she wasn’t interested, yet she showed up in his backyard. His heart rate rose a bit higher and with a light gait left his room. He listed down the stairs; careful not to wake up his dad, and finally arrived at the front door. 

Grabbing the door handle and slowly turning it, the mechanism in the door began to operate, making it ring out clicking noises. It reverberated across the entrance. In the slight gap he managed to open, stood a silhouette. Esther was already in front of the door, waiting, smiling. Finn couldn’t help but let out a yelp as she had been closer than he thought. 

“Did I scare you?” Her crescent moon shaped eyes sparkled in the darkness like small sapphires.

“Not really…” Finn thought she really was pretty.

“Come follow me\!” The words flowing from her soft lips felt almost enchanting. Ordering him to follow after her.

“Where are we going?” They were heading into the forest out back.

“Just a bit further?” She said without turning. Her golden hair flowed like wings under the bright full moon, shining beautifully. It was like he was following a fairy.

“What do you mean?” They had walked quite the distance. “What did you want to talk about?” 

He felt his heart thumping in his mouth. They finally stopped. Standing in the middle of the moonlit forest was Him and Esther. His father had often played with him in this very forest, sometimes even camping through the night, saying a knight must know how to sleep outside. He was fond of his dad, he wanted to be just like him. Esther turned around, her smile shone brighter than even the moon above.

“This looks like a good spot”

“A spot for what?” His heart was thumping like it wanted to jump out of his mouth. 

“I have a confession I want to make.” She hid her dainty hands behind her back. 

Oh, my goddess, a confession\! Calm down. Finn felt his palms get sweaty, and his knees felt heavy. Play it cool, Finn. Remember how she called you stupid.

“W-what is it?” Damn it, his voice cracked.

“I think you already know.” She smiled shyly. “Close your eyes for me?”

Finn was utterly done. With his eyes closed, he heard her soft footsteps inch closer and closer. 

“You know Finn…” She trailed the last letter of his name. 

“I really. Really, really. Hate people like you\!” A sudden sharp feeling poked at his neck, throwing him over backwards. Opening his eyes in shock, Esther was standing there. The dagger she held glinted in the summer night.

What? Why didn’t it pierce his neck?

“Huh?” The boy on the ground said stupidly. “Did you just stab me?” He was touching the spot where I had thrusted. Damn\! I need to kill him right now\!

“Stay away\!” He scrambled to his feet to get away from me, before tripping over his own feet, planting his face in the dirt. I can’t let him get away.\!

With heavy feet, I ran over to him. He had turned over like a turtle, legs sprawling out towards me. “What are you doing\!” He crawled backwards, eventually hitting his back against one of the many trees in the dark forest.

I stood above him, my feet between his squirming legs. I raised my dagger again, I must have just missed the last time, I still wasn’t familiar with this body. Seeing my dagger, as it shined in the dark, Finn raised his arms to protect himself. Idiot, I can just stab it through that opening\! 

“Stop\!”

I stabbed him in the throat. 

“Aaa\!”

I heard him scream, but the soft sensation of flesh was nowhere to be felt. My dagger had bounced off.

I stabbed again

It bounced off again. A golden circle sparkled under the tip of my dagger.

What? 

Finn looked at me with a shocked expression before moving his body. I could see the horizon flip over as I saw a shoe land squarely into my gut. The knife flew across my eyes, shining like a shooting star.

I tried to gather air back into my lungs, only managing to let out small heaves. It hurt. I couldn’t move my body. Why didn’t the dagger go through his throat?

“You’re crazy\!” He stood up. “You’ve gone insane\!”

Don’t say that. You know I’m not insane. I know I’m not.

“What do I do, what do I do?”

I tried to move my body, but it just hurt so much. A rib must have been broken. 

“Dad, I have to wake up dad\!”

The cold grass caressed my face. I had to run. I can’t let Victoria find out-

“You did this to yourself\!”

Something approached and slammed into my head. My mind went blank.

\*\*\*

“Wake up sleepyhead, class’ done already.” 

Where am I? A girl was sitting on my desk as she checked her phone.

“Hellooo? Earth to \*\*\*” A hand appeared in front of me, waving back and forth. 

“Karrie?” What’s she doing here?

“Karrie? Who’s that? I’m Ann, stupid. Your one and only friend. Did you have a silly dream or something?”

I glanced around, it was my old classroom. There were some formulas written on the blackboard, but it seemed like greek to me, literally. 

Ann was wearing our school uniform.

“Whats the date?”

“Wow, gross... Did you read too many stupid books again? Here check it out.”

Turning her phone toward me, I saw the date. It was 20XX.

“That can’t be…”

I could hear the bustling noises of people walking outside our classroom. There were always people talking outside our classroom.

“What do you mean?” Ann placed a pencil on the tip of her nose, balancing it.

“I killed you, you are supposed to be dead.” The pencil snapped in half, each half making a sound as it hit my desk.

“Oh, right”

The classroom shattered, everything disappearing. 

Ann was currently laying in a casket. Countless people had gathered around it, all wearing black. They looked familiar but I couldn't recognize them, all of them had a funeral veil on. The sounds of crying and hiccuping could be heard all over. It was maddening.

“Is this better?” Ann smiled.

Plastered all around were huge flower crests. The fragrant smell coming from them did not help my confusion. The walls of flowers were pressing in on me. I felt my sweat trickle down my back. The wailing people grabbed onto me, dragging me down into the ground. I commanded my legs to run out of here, but they were stuck in the floor as it slowly sank.

Standing atop her own casket, Ann stared down at me. 

“Tell me.”

A pair of brown eyes pierced my own. I didn’t want to look at her.

“Did you really have to kill me?”

She was smiling in the corner of my eye.

\*\*\*  
“You did well my son. Just go back to sleep. Your dad will sort out this misunderstanding."

I couldn’t see.

“It wasn’t a misunderstanding\! She tried to kill me\! Look\!”

My head ached.

“I understand, just go back to your room.”

“But Dad\!”

My hands were tied.

“I won’t say it twice.”

He paused. “What are you going to do”

My legs were tied.

“Go to your room.”

The sound of footsteps getting farther and farther away. A door opened and slammed shut.

“I know you are awake, kid.”

“Where am I?”

“Somewhere secret.” He answered. “Oh I almost forgot.”

The thing covering my eyes vanished. A lamp blinded my eyes struggling to adapt to the brightness. There were a bunch of tools hanging on the wall, hammers, saws and knives. It looked like some carpenter’s workshop.

“So you are Victoria's daughter?” It was the captain of the guards, Finn's father.

“Can you let me go?” I needed to stay calm in these scenarios. 

“Sorry little girl, but I don’t think so.”

“What do you want?” 

“Straight to the point I see.” The corners of his mouth reached his eyes. Calm yourself, don’t waste your energy.

“Ah, ah ah\!” He sang, wagging his finger at me. “Don’t waste your energy, no one has broken free from those knots before\!” He seemed proud.

“Why are you doing this?” I had to buy time, where is the way out?

“Why? Isn’t that obvious?”

“What about your son? What would Finn think?”

He grabbed my head. “How dare you utter his name.”

“It doesn’t matter what he thinks\! He just needs to be safe\!” His face looked just like the paintings of demons the temple liked to hang up. I felt a familiar scent in the dusty air. The rope was digging into my wrists.

“You’re insane.”

“Me? Insane? You tried to kill my son\! You are the insane one here\!” Some of his spit landed on my cheek.

“What did he do to you\!”

What did he do? “It’s personal”

“Hah\! Is that right? Personal.” His face was devoid of emotion.

“Then would it be personal if I paid your mother a visit? What was her name again, Victoria?” He licked his smiling lips, then glared at the air.

“That damn vixen\! Always flaunting herself everywhere she goes\! Who does she think she is\!” He moved his arms erratically around, making them cast long shadows in the room.

“That’s right, I can just pay her a visit. A personal one.” What?

“Don’t…” I mumbled.

He took a step closer. “What was that?”

“Don’t…” He turned his ear toward me, getting closer. “Don’t you dare touch her\!” I slammed into his head with my own, falling over in the process, chair and all. The pain from my broken rib made my adrenaline spike.

“You touch her and I will kill-”

The tip of his boot dug into my gut. “You demon brat\!” I spat out blood.

“That does it, after I’m finished with you”, he yanked my hair, “your pretty little mother is next.”

He set me back up. I had to get out of here, Victoria was in danger. I have to at least tell Gale. Think, there was always a way out-

He pulled out a small box filled with white roses. There were ten of them. He went to one of the walls, taking with him a hammer. He took one of the roses and placed it under my left hand.

“What are you doing?”

He lifted his hammer, positioning it above my left hand.

“Hey wait.”

The hammer ascended higher, above my little finger on my left hand. He was grinning.

“Wait, stop\!”

# Chapter 8: Why

“Honey, wake up”

“Hmm?” 

Gale’s body shook as something rustled him. What a shame, he had a good dream too. A big deer had shown up with magnificent antlers. How much money would those fetch for? 

“Gale get up.”

“What is it…” Five more minutes… Victoria, think about how much those antlers would get. That’s at least six or seven gold– Smack\! His face got slapped into oblivion waking him up.

“Galen Nikodemus\!”

“Wh-what is it?” A red handprint pulsed on his face as he took in the situation. It was dark, his sword was within arms reach. Who was stupid enough to intrude into his home?

“I can’t find Esther\!” Victoria seemed about to cry.

“What do you mean, isn’t she in bed?” His daughter wasn’t the type to move much, even less so after she lost her memories. 

“She isn't\!" His wife told him that even checking all the other rooms, Esther hadn’t been anywhere. Leaping out of bed, Gale ran towards his daughter’s room. His stomach dropped as it confirmed what his wife had said.

“Esther\!” Victoria ran out of the house yelling her daughter’s name in the wind. “Where are you\!” Having the moonlight reflect on her face, Gale could see her haggard expression. 

“Victoria”, he called out to her.

“Esther\! Please come out\!” She searched the nearby bushes, flinging them side to side like finding a needle in a haystack. 

“Victoria\!” He shook her by the shoulders. “She’s not here.”

“What do you mean?” With dirty hands and nightgown, she stared at her husband with a blank expression. 

“I can’t sense her with my mana”

Victoria went quiet. Her shoulders fell.

“Can you find her?”

“Don’t worry”, Gale wrapped a coat around her. “I will find her no matter what.”

After ensuring that the surroundings didn’t have any intruders, they went to their neighbors. A drowsy couple opened the door. Gale explained the situation and asked if they could look after Victoria in the meanwhile. With no resistance, they accepted. 

Closing his eyes, Gale began focusing on the air surrounding his body. This was a vital step in collecting the fragments of mana found everywhere in nature. Practicing this technique whenever he could, this had been routine for someone like Gale. However, it was abnormally hard to control his senses today.

Calm yourself, Gale repeated in his mind. Something warm entered his body as they traveled through his veins up to his eyes. He had successfully absorbed mana in the air. Opening his eyes, the world lit up in numerous colors. Reds, blues and yellows. Five glowing trails of mana could be seen in the area. Four of them seeping into the lonely house in the middle of the night, and a fifth heading towards the town. It was gray. 

The different colors indicated a person's innate affinity for mana, whether they could use it or not. Gray was not a color Gale had seen before, but he surmised that it had something to do with her inability to accept divine magic. 

What was his daughter doing walking to the town at this time? He began sprinting, following the gray trail as the moon shone onto his back. 

\*\*\*  
“AHH\!” My little finger was crushed.

“Stop\!” The hammer slammed into the base of the finger.

“Why shouldI?” He looked confused. “You tried killing my son\!” A fresh flower was put under my hand again. Under the finger that had it’s outer flesh ripped out. I felt my heart pulse through my body as the fat layer peeked at me. Light yellow. Squirming. It was disgusting.

“Ahhh\!” The hammer crushed another one of my fingers. Painting another rose.

“No one touches my son without my permission\!”

Why, why why. Why was this happening?

“Shh, don’t you cry little girl.” My hair ruffled in his hand. “The goddess will welcome us all with open arms\!” The goddess? “You know that right?” He changed the flowers. There were two red roses staring at me on the table. 

“Shh, don’t you cry little girl.” My hair was yanked after with his hand. “The goddess will welcome us all with open arms\!” The goddess? He changed the flowers. Two red roses, like the eyes of a snake were staring at me.

“Huh?”

“I was a lost little lamb just like you when my wife died. But you know what? It was remarkably easy to find the right road again\!” My blood dripped everywhere as he flung the hammer this and that way. “All I had to do was donate a small part of whatever I earned\!” 

“I was a lost little lamb just like you when my wife suddenly died. But you know what? It was remarkably easy to find the right road again\!” My blood flew everywhere as he swung the hammer this way and that way. “All I had to do was donate some money\!”

“Ugh\!” A third finger was mangled. 

“Money\! All everyone cares about is money\! I thought they would be different, but no, even those priests preaching about the greed of mankind grabbed my dirty coins. It was everything I had.” He suddenly stopped moving. He was staring into the air. “It was everything.”

“That wench had used it all\!” I could hear my own shriek echoing in the room after he broke my fourth finger. He didn’t even swap out the rose.

A thumb was what separated us humans from animals, someone said to me once. I took solace in that thought as he dropped the hammer, letting it thud to the floor. Would I be able to leave now?

“She used me\! Me\! Do you understand?\!” I don’t understand. I don’t understand any of it. Why was I reincarnated? Did the goddess send me here? Was this my punishment? I don’t get it.

“Not a single thing was left for my son. How could she.” Tears rolled down his face. “You, why would she do that? Shouldn’t a parent protect their own children?”

“I d-don’t know…”

“Right.” He smacked his forehead. “What was I thinking. Stupid, stupid stupid stupid.” Four loud smacks. Then he began laughing. Keeling over grabbing his own stomach he laughed loud enough to make my ears ring. Oh, he was insane. I was going to die here.

“Enough\!” Following him with my eyes, he went to the wall. 

“Please…” He picked up a knife. I was just starting to be familiar with this life. Eating tasty food, waking up in a warm bed, getting hugged by Victoria. All those things made me want to live. The knife shone in the light as he came closer.

“Mom…” I really don’t want to die again.

“Don’t you worry”, he raised his knife, “you will be able to meet her soon.”

I’m sorry mom. I can’t stop crying. I promise that I’m not meaning to. Just don’t leave me again.

The knife cut into my neck, severing my veins and letting the musty air invade through a new slit in my throat. Or it should have happened. Opening my eyes I saw something glow below my eyes.

“What?” 

“Hah.” I had to laugh.

“What the hell is this?” Another glow filled my eyes as he tried to stab me again.

“Ah ha ha\!”

“What’s so damn funny you witch\!”

“You can’t kill me\!” 

He raised his arm and the next second my face met the dirty floor. He punched me. It hurt. That didn’t matter, as long as I wouldn’t die. I was about to spit out the bitter thing filling my mouth when something wrapped around my neck. He was choking me. Two rough hands was robbing my of air. Ah, I didn’t think of that. 

Twisting and turning my body did little to stop my suffocation. I think it made it worse. Dark spots were beginning to cover my eyes.

Dying should only be experienced once per life. But here I was, about to lose my second life. It must have been a curse. Would I simply die again in my next life? And in the life after that? Living was suffering. That sentence flooded my mind as I grasped for air, holding on to the single strand of life still left in me. Then my lungs expanded. I could breathe again.

Something had sent him flying across the room, letting all the tools fall over him. The thudding of their reveberated to my eyes as it traveled through the floor. Grabbing the closest thing, he pointed it at the person standing in front of me. 

“Who the hell are you\!”

“Shut up you bastard\!” His voice was similar. “You dare touch my daughter\!” Oh, it was Gale, my father. Something plopped onto the ground with a soft thud. It was a hand. Spurting out blood from it’s cut end, it still held onto the knife. With a swift strike, my father had it sliced it off with his sword.

“My hand\!” He let out a roar like an animal.

“Shut your damn mouth\!” A few teeth clattered to the ground when his face smashed into my father’s boot.

“S-shtop\!” Shielding his face did little to stop the sword. Another hand met the floor, this time a little bit of arm was connected to it. He had cut cleanly through his skin, muscles and bone.

“Ahhh w-wait\!”

He swung his sword again. It was the left leg this time. Right under the kneecap, where the two bones met eachother, my father severed it with pinpoint precision. A pool of blood had gathered under the triple-amputated man.

“W-wait\!”

Another slash, another leg.

“You\! Do you know who I-”

“You goddamn demon\!”

The blade sliced cleanly through his esophagus, his vertebrae and the rest of his neck. His head was sent flying through the air before rolling on the dirty floor, picking up all the bits of dirt and grime. His eyes were still open as they stared at me.

“Esther\!” He turned toward me, covered in blood and sweat. “Oh my goddess, let me get you out of here.” he began untying my hands and feet.

“Dad…”

“Yes, your dad is here, I’m here.”

“It hurts…”

“You’re fine, don’t you worry”. He picked me up into his arms.

“I thought I was going to die…”

“You’re not going to die, I’m here. Shh.”

“I don’t want to die…” I clung to my father.

# Chapter 9: Aftermath

Victoria was pacing around and around the living room of her neighbors. Her eyebrows were scrunched up at the thought of her disappeared daughter. There had been some violent crimes recently, it couldn't be right? Why would they take–

Someone grasped her arm, making her stop pacing. “Victoria, how about we calm down a little first?” It was her friend. “I’m sure nothing happened to her.”

Victoria sighed as she got dragged to the couch. She would always reassure her in these kinds of situations. But not this time.

“How can you be so sure of that? She disappeared in the middle of the night. Are you saying Karrie also disappears sometimes?” Her voice contained a twinge of something rare. Irritation.

“Hah, you don’t even know the times when we had to lock the door to her room, lest she would run off somewhere.” The husband answered.

“Really?” They told her girls of that age would do that sometimes. In fact, she had been lucky Esther had been such a docile girl. 

“We’re lucky enough that our daughter decided to sleep soundly in her room tonight.”  
 He went to open a cupboard, taking out a bottle of wine and three glasses. Letting out glugs, the bottle filled the empty cups with a blood red color. 

“And you’re not worried?” Victoria rubbed her knuckles. “I don’t think Esther has any reason to go out…” 

“Worried about what? We live too far away from the town for anything dangerous to happen–” The front door slammed open. A harsh breeze invaded their living room, cooling it down immediately. Victoria felt her heart sink, spotting the pair in the doorframe. 

“Victoria\!” It was her husband holding their vanished daughter. She should have been elated seeing her daughter, but couldn't. It was red. As red as the toppled over glass of wine spreading across the wooden table. The grains were seeped with the red liquid in the same manner as the once white cloth wrapped over her daughter’s hand. 

“I need more bandages now\!” Hearing his roar, Victoria forced her frozen body to move. She had been in this house often, often enough to know where the medicinal supplies were located. All she had to do was move her legs.

“Clear the table\!” The wide-eyed pair jerked into motion as they plucked the things off as ordered. First the glasses, then the bowls of nuts, and at last the vase of wildflowers. 

Victoria clutched the rough bandages in her hands as she watched Gale put down their daughter. Even with all the noises and movements, her daughter didn’t open her eyes. 

“Esther\!” Her sweet daughter’s face was dirty. Her clothes were dirty too, covered in two different shades of red.

“Ah…” It didn’t look like a hand. She had removed the red bandages and instead of what she had expected, something mangled greeted her instead. Like a puzzle that didn’t have a guide, she began piecing the slices of flesh together, trying her best to cover the bits of white that wanted to show itself. 

“Ah\!” It was slippery. It was mushy. Even when her tears blocked her view, she kept on wrapping the fingers. Why were all these things happening to her?

The stairs leading up to the second floor creaked as a groggy Karrie peeked from the steps. She had woken up from all the commotion happening downstairs and wanted to investigate. Rubbing her eyes, she held onto the guard rail. “Mom… What’s happening?”

There were four people in their living room, no make that five. Someone was lying on the table too. 

“Karrie\! Go back to your room\!” Her mother moved in front of Karrie, intending to block her view.

“Huh?” Alas, it was too late. She saw that her friend Esther was lying on the dinner table. Dozens of red bandages littering the room.

TK maybe move this whole part to previous chapter\*\*\*

The incident threw the whole town into chaos. The captain of the guards had died, his body displayed in the middle of town square for all to see, his limbs stacked like bricks on his body. The townspeople started protesting, demanding the capture of the Executioner. The Baron, now without his trusted captain, had to listen to the angry mob, lest he be trampled under their angry feet. A missive had been sent from Barre and resultingly, a bunch of guards from the surrounding towns and cities got sent to our town. It must have cost the Baron a lot.

Dad investigated the secret area and found a field of white roses growing in the dark. I didn’t know what to feel that Finn's father had been The executioner, I didn’t want to feel anything about that matter. 

The newly appointed captain of the guards took the new recruits and did a town-wide search and found the secret area. My dad had erased all traces of us and made it seem like he left town. The guards came to that conclusion and relayed the facts to the townspeople. Seeing the massive number of guards patrolling their streets, they had to reluctantly accept the theory. 

Nothing happened the following weeks and the townspeople began celebrating each week that passed without a murder, it was like a small festival that attracted the neighboring towns and cities. The Baron was beyond happy that more people spent money in his town.

And so two months had passed. The leaves were turning brown and thin summer dresses changed into longer dresses and coats. The skin on my left hand had healed on its own but the damaged fingers could still not fully bend. Scars and disfigured flesh marred my skin where the hammer had hit it. 

My mom was beside herself when she first saw me being carried in by my dad. The physical pain was extreme, but the pain of hearing my moms sobbing through the night hurt me more. She had cried for two weeks straight. 

She had calmed down considerably, now only hovering around me occasionally. A sad expression crept onto her face each time she saw my hands, which made me want to start wearing gloves. Telling her this only made her sadder. The next day a pair of comfy gloves sat on my hands.

“They’re pretty.” Karrie said. She was visiting me again today. 

“Thanks.” 

“Does it still hurt?”

“Yeah.”

Only staying in the house was starting to get boring, so her visits were welcome. However, our conversations left something to be desired. 

“Have they found Finn yet?” I asked.

“No…” She leant in closer and whispered. “Eric and I think that he got taken by the Executioner.” That was the funniest thing I’ve heard these last couple of months. 

Karrie went on to tell me about her day like usual. She made a pile of leaves which Eric had ruined by jumping into it. She finally found a beetle half the size of her hand, and Eric had done something stupid again. 

“I heard that an acting troupe will be visiting our town soon\!” Her eyes glimmered. “Do you think they will be handsome or pretty? Maybe they will be both\!”

“Who knows.”

“Ah, you’re always like this, we young maidens should be out and find someone special.”

“I think you've read too many romance novels.” 

“Novels? What are those? But I like the sound of romance.” She hugged her own shoulders. 

“Should we go together?” 

“Are you well enough to do that?”

“Watch this.” Swooping my legs off the bed, I planted my thin feet firmly on the ground. “Ta da”

Karrie let out a ‘whoah’ and clapped her hands. Then stopped as I had to catch myself on the bed. 

“Give me one more week…”

One more week passed and my body was finally well enough to actually go do something besides idling. And today I was escorted by both Eric and Karrie to go see the acting troupe hold a play.

“But I’ve already seen–” 

“Shhh\!” Karrie smacked Eric on the shoulder.

“Oh wow… I wonder what play they are going to hold…”

“I don’t really know but it should be something amazing\!”

“I’ve never seen a play before.” I had never been to a cinema for that matter either.

“Well, that’s because you are always at home. Mmph\!” 

“Haha, then prepare yourself to be amazed.” Karrie was holding both her hands to Eric’s mouth at this point. 

A scene had been erected in the town square. The actors began their play as applause from the crowd died down. Their movements and clothes gripped my attention throughout.

It began with a commoner girl singing and dancing all the while sweeping the floor with a broom. Someone was knocking on her door making her stop. It was a well clad man donning a cane and a tall hat. 

“My dear daughter, it is I, your father.”

Her father was a baron and had sought after her after hearing that one of the maids that had run away had borne a child. The girl looked flabbergasted as she rode in the carriage. 

“No more cleaning, no more sweeping?”

“That’s right, you are now a noble like I.”

A flute played a gentle song as she took in her new surroundings, sounding like chirping birds. Learning how to eat, learning how to act and learning how to put on extravagant dresses. She looked happy.

Fast forward and she was entering the royal academy. A place where other nobles would meet her for the first time. 

“Oh noes\! I have wandered too far and lost my way. What ever shall I do?” 

“Milady fret not. It is but a minute walk away from here.” A blond princely face greeted us, making some of the women in the crowd let out murmurs. Karrie had been bewitched it looked like. 

“My good sir, can you help me find the way?”

“I can’t see why I can't.”

The pair of them went to the entrance where a woman was waiting. She had a blood red dress and even spotted a hand fan.

“Eugene, where have you been and who is that woman sticking onto you like a leech?” Clack, a satisfying sound reverberated as she folded the fan.

“A leech she is not, she was just lost is all. Lady Lara.”

She pointed her fan at the leech. “And who is this lost lady that managed to find my fiancee?”

“Oh\! My name is Rebecca\!” She curtsied.

“Hmpf. What a horrid greeting.”

The second act of the play went on to detail Rebecca’s academy life as she routinely got harassed by Lara. The crowd jeered each time she appeared on the stage. Booed, when she reprimanded the heroine for always being with the prince. Cried when the heroine got soaked from tea. And cheered when Eugene ran towards her each time Lara did something to her.

I found it amazing that the actor could maintain her composure in this atmosphere, it was the same for Lara. Not only did the crowd jeer, even her classmates did the same. 

“Don’t you think she went too far this time?” Classmate one asked.

“Be quiet, you don’t want to witness her wrath for yourself.” Classmate two replied.

“But how could she do that to the poor lady Rebecca? Whatever did she do?”

The crowd nodded in agreement. Why?

Lara had justification in doing all those things. Eugene was her fiancee, then why was she always hovering around him? My skin began itching as the crowd went against all my expectations. 

The scene was now a solo act, where Lara planned her next action. She held up a small vial.

“With this the leech will finally let go of my fiancee\! No longer will he turn his eyes toward that wretched woman\!” 

But she didn’t do it. She didn’t poison the leech. Hiding it in her room, she went on to meet with her fiancee. A basket of homemade cookies in her hand. Eugene had invited her to a picnic on this fine morning. 

The basket fell to the ground as she approached the location. Rebecca had already arrived before her. Giggling and laughing at each and every word coming out of Eugene’s mouth. 

She gave up.

“Perhaps it is fate… All my life for this moment to be stolen away…”

Lara you idiot. If you hated her that much, then why didn’t you just kill her? Ah. She couldn’t. Just like me.

The third act opened with Rebecca getting poisoned at the royal ball. Eugene was holding the heroine in his arms in front of a shocked crowd.

“Lara\! Why did you poison her?\!” Eugene roared. A gathering of guards rushed in from the sides. 

“I did no such silly thing.” She didn’t even glance at him, only looking over at us, the audience. “Have you even checked whether or not she really has been poisoned?”

“How can you say that with this damning evidence\!” A vial was presented for us to see. It was the same vial that she had hid in her room.

“I had thought you to be better than this\!” The hero caressed the girl in his arms. “Guards\! Take her away\!”

Stripped of all her titles and responsibilities, she could do nothing but lament the situation. Lara was to be executed for her transgressions. Sitting in the cold dungeon, a pitiful soliloquy started.  
“Oh, goddess. Why have you set up my fate like this? Why couldn’t you just give my life to that leech before I gave my heart away?” She stretched towards the heavens. “Why have you forsaken me?” TK read ending of the stranger

The play ended with the death of the former fiance of the prince. At the scene of the marriage, claps rang in my ears as everyone around me cheered and whistled for the ‘true’ pair. It was loud. It was irritating. My hand was beginning to hurt as I had to clench them. This was ridiculous.   
   
\*\*\*  
I glared at the statue towering over me. What’s so funny, huh? The marble face smiled at me.

We were visiting the church today. Father had asked, or demanded, that the head priest use his healing magic on me. In the hopes that a greater amount of divine magic would be different. The eternally smiling priest frowned for a second as something unpleasant entered my body before bouncing off.

The sun shone through the stained glass, blinding my eyes in red. Why was I reincarnated? Was this even a reincarnation? I took over someone’s dead body and still had my own memories. The monks said that life was like a wheel, neither a start nor an ending existed. Would that explain my current situation? Nothing made sense. I glared at the statue.

And why did my knife bounce off his neck? I wouldn’t have been captured had he just died right there in that forest, there and then. It was perfect. A bitter taste filled my mouth as my teeth ground against each other. The golden circles had both blocked my knife and his knife. 

“Is this your doing?” My own voice echoed in the empty prayer room. Silence

“Why did you send me here?” The goddess just looked at me, smugly.

“What am I supposed to do\!” I stood up.

“I don’t understand.” 

“I said I don’t understand\!” 

The sun stood behind the statue, like a guardian giving it a golden halo. Its rays were still stabbing in my eyes, not caring in the least that it blinded me.

“Don’t you look at me like that, wipe that goddamn smile off your face\!”

It was heavy. Her gaze made me fall to my knees. The carpet felt rough and hard.

“Say something… anything…”

“I didn’t ask for this…” A handful of the itchy carpet gathered in my fists.

“I can’t even kill anyone in this life\!” I banged on the carpeted floor. “What am I supposed to do?\!” It hurt. 

“I can’t do this…” Pebbles fell down from somewhere, staining the blood-red carpet with dark circles. “Tell me what to do…”

“Esther\!” Quick steps ran over to me, wrapping me in something warm. “What’s wrong?” She hugged me.

I didn’t want her to see me like this, hiding myself into her arms, I dug my face until nothing was visible in my eyes. “Mom…”

“What is it sweetie? It’s okay, just tell me”

“I want to go home…”

“Of course, we will go home right away.” Her fingers ran through my hair. 

“My sweet little Esther”

# Chapter 10: Birthday

I don’t actually remember when my birthday was, I just increased my age by one when the year ended and the fireworks kept me up all night. The years seemed to become shorter the higher my age went. Why did I think about my birthday? Because today was Esther’s. My congratulating mom told me so.

The freezing winds were starting to warm up as the snow began to melt. Dazzling like small stars, the liquid snow crystals slid down my bedroom window. A pile of snow fell down from one of the naked trees, letting out a satisfying crunch as it met the ground.

One of the monks staying at the temple would always complain about his leg when winter came around. You don’t understand, he told me. The cold freezes the muscles, pulling the bone all over the place. I did truly not understand, how would some weak muscles be able to do that. However, even after wrapping my hand in layers and layers of gloves and scarves, it ached. It really ached.

“Is there anything you want?” A small plume of air went out of my moms mouth. We were going shopping today.

“Not really.” 

“There must be something?” She looked concerned again. “How about a new pair of gloves?”

“I like the ones you made.” Trying to find something to wish for left my head empty. I have never had to practice wishing for something before, there simply wasn’t an opportunity to do so. What was the point of wishing anyway.

“Maybe a cake?” We had passed by a bakery or a patisserie earlier. Whatever the difference was, a sugary smell had attracted me to it nonetheless. Peeking through the frosted windows at the meager display of baked goods made me want one for myself.

“Hmm.” My mom pondered for a second before telling me that buying a whole cake would put a sizable dent in our budget. I was shocked hearing her tell me the price. Well, there goes my first ever wish. Letting out a big ball of exhale, my shoulders slumped.

“However, we can just make our own\!” She puffed out her chest.

“Really? You can make your own cake?” 

“Sure you can, don’t you trust your mother?”

My mom was dazzling and cool today too. She wore a coat which had taken a long time to make. Father had hunted some fluffy animal or monster and given it’s fur as a gift to her. Ever since that day she had been sitting in her favorite chair and slowly stitched together a whole coat. In fact, my jacket was made by her too. 

Surrounded by the soft fur, her face peeked out from under the hood. Would I become as pretty as her growing up? Bouncing in tandem with her steps, my feet felt lighter. Something was making my frozen face stretch under the early spring sun. Feeling my face muscles made me realize what it was. I was smiling.

“Of course I trust you, I don’t think there is anything you can’t make.”

“Oh Esther\! You are so sweet\!” I got glomped by my mom.

Baking a cake appeared to be far easier than I thought. Either that or my mom was an expert at cooking. Seeing the setting batter in the stone oven, it had to be the latter. The same sweet smell I had noticed earlier today was wafting around the warm kitchen. My face felt like melting sitting there in front of the oven.

“Hopefully it turns out something befitting my lovely daughter.” She rested her hand on my crouching figure. 

“It looks amazing.” How could some flour, sugar and some other things blend together to make a cake? It looked haphazard as she threw them all together in a bowl without even using a recipe. ‘A recipe? Maybe I should write them down’, she said. 

A low voice called out to us. “Oh, what’s the special occasion today?” 

“Dad\!” Running up to him, he caught me in his arms. His messy bed hair indicated that he had just woken up. Mom should really be a little stricter with him. Half the day had already vanished. 

“You really don’t know?” To be fair, I didn’t know either before today. But that didn’t stop me from glomping him. 

He chuckled for a bit. “Happy birthday, Esther.” Something wrapped appeared in front of me. “What’s this?” It had a bow tied to it, two bunny ears I recalled someone say. 

“It’s your present.” The insides rattled as I shook it, it sounded metally.

“Thanks\!” A bubbling feeling inside me made me feel fuzzy.

“Thank you for giving your father such a pretty smile.” He ruffled my hair. “Why don’t you open it?”

“Open it?” Open what?

“Shouldn’t we wait for the guests to arrive?” My mom asked.

“What guests?” The two of them simply smiled at my question. 

Karrie was the first to arrive with her parents. Congratulations filled the room as they gave me their happy birthday’s 

“When’s your birthday?” I sat with Karrie in the living room as the adults moved to the kitchen.

“I’m a spring baby.” We were both slumped into the couch, trying to find the most comfortable position to sit. It appeared having my back rest on the seat was the most comfortable.

“Your couch is really dangerous…” Karrie had melted into the cushions.

“It really is…”

“What silly thing are you two doing now?” Karrie’s mother looked at us.

“We are becoming one with the couch…”

“Look at how you have influenced Esther. I’m sorry for this, Victoria.” Her mother shook her head hearing Karrie’s answer.

“It’s fine isn’t it? Look how cute those two are.”

“I can only see one cute one…”

“Mom, I can hear you…” The couch had eaten her at this point.

The last guest was Eric, who had just arrived. A small pile of snow rested on his red hair as he shook it off like a dog. 

“What stupid thing are you two doing now?” 

“It’s not stupid.” I said.

“Yeah, you’re the stupid one.” Karrie added.

“You three really do take after one another.” We ‘sat’ in a row on the couch, Eric had joined us. My mom’s comment made me realize that we had really gotten much closer these past months. Rarely was there a day where I didn’t see either one of them. 

Friends were hard to come by in my previous life, which was why I was often alone. It was fine, I had told myself. Being alone was preferable if it meant they didn’t get to know me. 

Keeping an arms length from others had an effect where people stopped talking to me altogether. Perhaps they noticed that I tried to hide something or that my replies were always the same. You’re so boring, they said. Talking with you exhausts me.

These two never said something like that. They were always calling each other stupid to notice these things. But did I really need to act the same way? There was nothing to hide besides the fact that the real Esther was dead. Not once did they suspect me for being someone else. Maybe we had a similar personality? A smacking sound pulled me out of my thoughts. Eric had done something stupid again.

“You’re going to leave Barre tomorrow?”

“Yup, gonna follow my dad’s work.”

“Isn’t he a merchant?” Earning money by buying things. It sounded silly, a merchant’s job that is. 

“That’s right.”

“Eric is too stupid for that.” Isn’t being a merchant a hard job?

“Esther, you mixed your thoughts again.”

“Mixed or not, you’re really leaving the town?” Karrie shook his collar.

“Kids\!” My mom called to us. “Dinner’s ready.”

Birthdays were the best. Countless dishes stood ready on our dining table, almost spilling over with the amount of plates. I sat at the head of the table for the first time with my parents to either side of me.

Invited to my first ever birthday party and Esther’s fourteenth were: my parents, Karrie’s parents, Karrie and Eric. Their smiling faces radiated warmth as I took it in. All these people had gathered together for my sake. 

The sun streamed through the frosty windows, spreading itself across the room. Not a single speck of dust was to be seen in the air as chatter and jovial voices layered on top of each other. Like exhale in cold winter air, the dishes disappeared at a remarkable pace. It was time for the main dish. Mom’s homemade cake.

It looked just like the ones I saw through that window. My heart felt ticklish.

“Congratulations Esther\! May the goddess bless you\!” Yeah, no thanks. If the goddess could actually leave me be, then that would be great.

“What are you gonna wish for?” Eric asked.

“Of course she will ask for money\!” My father said.

“What are you saying? A growing girl only has one thing to wish for, gems and diamonds\!” Karrie’s father retorted.

“Oh, you’re right\! How hind-sighted of me\!”

Karrie’s mom let out a sigh. “You two…”  

“What are you going to wish for?” My mom asked. My wish? 

A warmth spread through the house giving it a cozy atmosphere. My father and Karrie’s were busy arguing on what a girl like me wanted to wish for. Sighs could be heard cutting through their points as they became more and more ridiculous. Karrie and Eric were busy trying to shove another spoonful of cake into themselves. And my mom, with her gentle blue eyes, was busy looking at me. 

“My wish…” The room went quiet.

It was awkward at first, but today, on such a happy day, my mouth smiled naturally. The air felt refreshing as it grazed my grinning teeth. All of them smiled expectantly at me, the birthday girl, to announce her wish. I had it.

“My wish is to always have days like–” A knock on the front door interrupted me.

“Sorry Esther, excuse me for a bit.” My father lifted his heavy body from the table. Following him with my eyes as he went to the door.

“Raviel? What are you doing here?” It was the lady with the pants and blue hair. She wore a thick dress today that was covered in glittering snow. The room had immediately melted them.

“I have come here today as a messenger”

“A messenger? From who?” My dad grasped the letter handed to him, flipping it over a few times. 

“I shall take my leave then.” Grabbing the sides of her skirt, she drew a leg behind herself and bent her knees. It was a perfect curtsy. “My lord.”

By the time I blinked, Raviel was already in the air, my father had lifted her by the neck with one hand.

“Who sent you?” His murderous aura filled the room, dispelling the previous joyful atmosphere.  

Raviel didn’t seem flustered at all.

“Your father.” She uttered.

The sound of something crashing reverberated through the room, signaling the end of my first birthday party.

# Chapter 11: New City

The steam coming from the cup of tea placed in front of me, flew gently toward the ceiling, eventually disappearing like a dream. Thrown on the dinner table was the letter Raviel had gifted my dad. The pure white piece of paper was crumpled, several creases were visible. Were you to follow those creases like a piece of origami, I would believe it would make a wonderful ball of paper. I glanced at my parents sitting at the table.

My mom gripped her cup of tea, stroking the handle with her thumb. “Do you know why you were called back?” 

“How should I know what my father is thinking?” My dad spat out. My mom’s shoulders shrank into herself, making her silhouette smaller. My fingers hurt as I tried clenching them. This scene was too familiar. My body began to prickle. 

He sighed. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to say it like that”, he said, covering mom’s hands. “It’s just… I really don't know.”

“How did they even find us?” Her hands were turning white as they wrapped around the cup. “Why now?” Glistening beads began to form in the corner of her eyes. She began to tremble. 

My dad stood up and wrapped her into his arms. No one said anything as he stood there, letting his wife crease up his ironed shirt. Wet stains formed where my mother’s face dug into his messed up shirt. The prickling was getting too much.

I went outside.

Taking in the cool winter air, my breath formed a little cloud as I exhaled. I thought happy days would follow me after my birthday party, however the nailing pain in my fingers drove my mind back to reality. The letter was like a curse, bringing with it misfortune. I hadn’t slept well, I hadn’t eaten well, and dad had gotten angrier and more irritable. My mom always hugged me, but it didn’t feel the same, she didn’t smile. 

I tried bending my fingers, only making it send a signal to my brain to stop. I put myself into the house and my parents had reached an agreement. We were to leave this town in four days.

\*\*\*  
“I still can’t believe it…” Karrie’s dad said. “How long are you going to be gone?”

We were currently loading our luggage into a horse-drawn wagon outside our house. My dad had made quick work stacking the boxes.

“I’m betting on being back here after six or seven days, at the latest we should be back by the start of spring.”

“Why are you being so clingy? I’m getting a little jealous." Karrie’s mom said. 

“Hey, what are you saying, woman.” Her husband shot back. 

“My best friend is leaving for the capital, what if he never returns\! Of course I should be clingy\!” He went in front of my dad, shielding him from his wife.

“Argh\! Get out of the way, why can’t you act like this with me\!”

The two of them had been shocked when my parents said that they would leave for the capital in three days. However, they didn’t ask any personal questions, only when we left and when they could expect to see them again. They bantered back and forth as the finalizations were finished. 

“My dear Victoria\!” She held my mom’s hands. “I can’t believe you are leaving me all alone in this town…”

“What are you saying? You still have your husband.” She smiled prettily. “And it’s only for a few weeks at most.”

Karrie’s mom clicked her tongue and feigned a faint, putting the back of her hand on her forehead. “I don’t think I can do it… I’m going to die in these few weeks…” 

My mom let out a laugh. “I promise I will send you letters should it come to that.”

“You better hold onto that promise\!” She said, giving her an enormous hug. 

Karrie had watched our moms hugging. “I don’t think I can do that…” 

“Why not? I like hugs”

She blushed. “It’s embarrassing.”

I had gotten familiar with practically seeing her everyday. We would chat together, take strolls together, and find ourselves in trouble when we occasionally made trouble. It reminded me of the time I spent with Ann. However I knew they were different people. They sometimes did the same things, but the more I talked with Karrie, the more different they appeared. 

I would probably not see her for quite some time. The distance from here to the capital was considerable, even when that shortened with the help of magic teleporting gates. I didn’t even get surprised when I first heard about them, I thought to myself, surprised. 

I threw my arms around Karrie, sharing with her some of my warmth. “Take care, Karrie.” 

“You too, Esther\!” 

Standing there surrounded by the melting snow, our smiles seemed to warm our surroundings.

Their waving arms had disappeared in the horizon as I sat back down in the rocking wagon. My body was getting jostled side to side by the wooden wheels grinding through the frozen ground. Today I learnt I was prone to getting wagon-sick.

I managed to eke out a question on how further we had to drive, to which my father simply smiled at me splayed onto my mother’s lap. We hadn’t even started, he said. I felt my eyes cloud over as my mother combed through my hair.

The Guillain Kingdom had an extensive network of magic gates connecting various cities together, making it easy for people to move around the vast land of the empire. As one might suspect, it cost a considerable sum to use one of these gates. As a result, only the rich were the ones using them. In the letter, demanding my dads return, was an eight-sided token. This was used by nobles to travel around the lands anonymously. Only high-ranking nobles had one of these. Duke Nikodemus must have really wanted his son to visit. 

Thinking about it, doesn’t that make my dad a noble? Would that make me a noble? I did find it weird how excessive dad disliked the Baron, but I never thought more about it. Mom seemed to also sometimes behave in an elegant manner, I liked to copy her when she did that. I wonder what my grandfather will be like. 

Thinking about it, doesn’t that make my dad a noble? Would that make me a noble? On television, drama series about rich conglomerates that had nothing to worry about would sometimes air. Riches, looks and bloodline, weren’t those essentially the same as this kingdom’s nobles? It didn’t sound bad.

No more would we have to concern ourselves with money and have time to do whatever we wanted. Honestly, why didn’t my parents use their status to their advantage? In hindsight, it was easy to see that we weren’t normal commoners. They would sometimes behave in a way totally different from Karrie’s parents. Not making a sound when drinking tea for example.

I asked Karrie once whether her parents danced together. “No way, as if my parents had the time and energy to learn something useless like that. Where would you even get music to dance to?” A scene where my parents danced in the kitchen in silence flowed into my mind. Would my grandfather act in the same way?

“Don’t get your hopes up, Esther. He isn’t the type of person to act like that.”

“What about my grandmother?” My parents smiled.

Mom answered my question. “She’s a wonderful woman.” She was smiling like her normal self. “Did you know she saved my life once?” 

It was a wonder how such contrasting reactions could come from a pair of people. How could such a mismatched couple even conceive a person like my father? My grandmother must be a really grand woman to raise him.

My parents chatted together as we traveled to the neighboring city where a gate was available. And finally, after a whole day of suffering on the seats of the wagon, we arrived at the entrance to the city.

“This looks good enough.” My dad opened the door to the room we had rented for the day. The magic gate required a half day's worth of time to check our luggage and clear it for transport. Not wanting to arrive earlier than required, my dad suggested resting in this city for a day. I welcomed that thought.

The bed smelled like the sun and I closed my eyes. They were still spinning from the horrid wagon ride. I pressed down the rising feeling in my stomach. Grabbing the pillow, I dug my face in it. That was a mistake. It smelt of lavender. I coiled into myself, letting the pillow fall to the floor.

My eyes were still spinning from the horrid ride and I could only throw myself into the bed to find some sort of refuge. Pressing my face into the pillow, its refreshing scent filled my nose. It smelt of lavender. The pillow fell to the floor as I coiled into myself like a snake.

“Oh, my poor daughter…” She patted my back. 

“I don’t want to ride the wagon anymore…”

My dads next words shattered that hope. “Sorry to say this, but we are still only halfway.”

“Mom…”

“Just rest for now, sweetie. We can go eat some delicious food later\!” She sounded cheerful.

*I didn’t want to eat anything*, was what I had previously thought as I stood there in the bakery. The smell of freshly baked bread filled the store, not letting a single visitor escape unscathed. Displayed by the counter stood countless types of pastries, ranging from simple wheat rolls to elegantly designed cakes in all types of colors. It looked just like one of those cafes I had seen in my previous life. 

I shook my pocketbook and heard some coins click, ringing out like small bells. My parents appeared to be in a joyous mood today, laughing and giggling while walking around the new city. I asked to go explore on my own, which had worried my mom and elated my father. He gave me a whole four silver coins to go do whatever I wanted for today. There were a total of five silver coins in my pouch, a considerable sum for someone like me.

The first silver coin I had gotten was still with me, accompanying me whenever I went out. The original idea was to spend it on something or the other, but like magic, the opportunity never came. Something was deliberately stopping me from using this coin, I thought. It was now my lucky charm. Did it do anything? Not really, but the thought was fun. 

“How much for a slice of that cake?” I pointed to something plain-looking.

“That’ll be five silvers.” The barista-looking woman answered. 

Five silver coins should be enough to buy enough to buy food for five whole days and still be left with some remaining. Why, our room cost us only three silvers for the day. I’ve never been good with money but didn’t that sound too much? I expected the golden circle to appear, but no matter how long I waited, it didn’t show up.

I pointed to a bag of cookies. “What about that?”

“That’ll be two silvers.” Something stabbed into my heart.

Pointing to a stupid looking bread roll I asked. “What about-”

“That’ll be three coppers.” The woman was smiling at me.

Sitting on a bench outside the bakery, I bit into my hard-gained bread roll. It tasted like bread. Feeling the dry taste of wheat, I remembered why I never used my own money on food. It was just disappointing. The people of the city passed by me busy with their own thoughts and plans. Carriages cackled on the cobbled road as the drivers steered the horses. 

The city road was double the size of those in Barre. Two whole carriages could pass by each other with no problem. The amount of people busily strutting to and fro down the sidewalks was also double. Double this, double that, it all just doubled my dizziness.

The pure white color of snow I had gotten used to seeing the past few months was nowhere to be seen. Replacing it was the color brown. Brown roads, brown horses and brown three-coppers costing bread. Something red broke up the monotony as it approached me.

“Eshter?” The red hair called out to me. “What are you doing here?”

I observed the boy that had left Barre a week ago. Karrie and I thought he was joking at first, but the day after my birthday, he was gone. 

He had grown considerably since the first time I saw him. In front of that store. The face had lost some of its boyness, getting a bit sharper and his shoulders looked to be sturdier. A few more years and he would definitely look more than decent. He crossed his arms and smirked at me.

“Did you get lost again?”

I considered throwing the half eaten piece of bread at his stupid face.

# Chapter 12: Eric

I put the rest of the bread roll into my pocketbook. “I’m not lost.”

“That so?” He plopped down beside me. My golden hair fluttered in the air as I bounced off the bench. The wooden planks were bending a bit.

“I heard you will be back by spring?” I nodded. We sat staring in the same direction looking at the other people walking by. 

“Are you here with your mom?” I didn’t see her with him.

“Yeah, we got some extra seeds from Klippel.” He pulled out a round black seed the size of my fingertip. Its outer shell felt rough as it laid limply on my palm, making a scratching sound when I poked it.

“I don’t get why no one buys them.” He pulled out another one and popped it into his mouth, crunching it between his teeth. I could see a few bits of the outer shell fall out of his mouth. It looked and sounded just like eating eggshells. 

“They don’t taste that bad.” He looked serious saying that. 

“What plant is this?”

“Dunno.”

“And you just ate it?” Incredible.

“I was hungry, okay?” He seemed almost offended. “I know what you just thought.”

“You’re imagining things.” 

I kicked my legs as we continued to people-watch. A man and woman were walking with their arms linked together. I wonder what my parents are doing right now.

“I’m bored. Let’s go do something.”

“Do what?”

“No idea, there must be something to do in this city.” He shook his bag of seeds. “Maybe I can find someone to buy these things.” He explained how his mother had assigned him to find someone willing to buy these off their hands. He popped another one into his mouth. 

“You know you are supposed to plant them right?” I remarked.

I glanced through the shop windows while strolling around with Eric. Whenever something weird or strange caught my eyes he would give me a quick and concise answer. His explanations seemed to make it seem more interesting than they really were. A set of ceramic cups could be seen through the window. They were apparently the local product of this city. The cups’ color was unique only to this region as it required a type of clay that could only be harvested around here. They just looked like green tea cups to me.

Eric would give me a long explanation each time I pointed to an object. He seemed to take his apprenticeship seriously as he knew a little about everything. I wondered how much he had studied these past days. I started pointing at whatever caught my eyes.

“Esther”, he looked thirsty, “I think you already know about all these things.”

“I don’t remember what they are.” I stood in front of a display where wares of different colors and shapes were being shaded by the stall. The vendor was busy haggling with the other customers, paying the two of us no mind. 

“You know that you can’t use that line anymore right?”  

“Eric, I really don’t remember, please.” I pointed to an orange object, feeling my mouth twitch as I begged him.

“At least try not to smile while saying that…” He sighed. “These are called carrots, a staple food in our kingdom.”

“Is that so? What about these yellow things?”

“Those are potatoes”

“And these?”

“Onions.”

“Your explanations are quite short, Eric. No one would buy anything from you with that attitude. You make a lousy merchant.”

He gave me a big professional smile. “Thanks, Esther. I will take that advice to heart.”

I skipped around the different shops and stalls all the while dragging along Eric. His shoulders slumped as he dragged his feet after me. That’s weird. I thought he was bored? The roads came to an end, opening up to a square with a clocktower standing in the middle. And below that a crowd had formed. 

The gaggle of people was centered around something. Applause and excited voices could be heard ringing as I tried to get a glimpse of whatever that had them this excited. Standing between two adults, I glanced under their armpits.

Mint green hair reminiscent of the tea cups I had seen blew gently in the air. It looked almost to turn blue against the backdrop of the sky. A pair of soft round eyes, the color of fresh summer leaves, looked flustered as she held the hands of an old woman kneeling before her. She looked like a doe clad in pastel dress as she tried to help the elderly woman off the dirty ground. 

A young man stood behind her, diagonal to the side, with his hands behind his back. He had an impassioned look standing guard behind her, the scabbard hanging on his hip indicating his work.

“Ah, please don’t do this\! Your clothes will get dirty.”

“My clothes getting dirty is nothing in comparison to what you have done for me. I must show you my gratitude\!”

“P-please get up, I didn’t help you to get your gratitude\!” She babbled.

“A simple thanks is enough for me.” An angelic smile formed on the young girl’s face, she looked just like how my mom often looked at me. I could feel the affection flowing from her gaze standing all the way over here.

The old woman broke into tears as she looked up at her.

“Ah, please don’t cry\!” She looked flustered again.

A voice called from the crowd. “She did it again\!”

“I can’t believe she used healing magic on her.”

“She did it for free too.”

“Did it work? I’ve never seen such a bright light before.”

The old woman finally stood up holding a cane in her hand. But the tip didn’t touch the ground, she held it with both her hands. 

Someone in the crowd exclaimed. “I can’t believe it\!”

“Who is she?”

“She’s a goddess\!”

Resounding cheers filled the area we had been gathering in. The old woman lifted her wooden cane high above her head, stretching it into the sky. The stick grabbed our attention as it went higher and higher. I could feel the guard putting his hand above the hilt of his sword, until we all saw it flying downwards at an amazing speed before stopping upon impacting her bent knee. It broke cleanly in half. Silence filled the air.

My mouth went wide as I tried to register in my head what had just happened. The girl seemed to be in the same vein as me standing there cupping her mouth. The young man standing a step behind her simply let out a sigh of relief before turning back into an impassioned statue. The silence broke when the old woman roared. 

“That felt good\!”

The crowd joined her roar and I could hear Eric beside yelling something or the other. 

I saw for the first time how healing magic was supposed to look like as she healed some other people from the crowd. A yellow magic circle formed from her palmed out hands as she focused her breathing. A few seconds later the person being injected let out a really blinding flash of light. It must have felt good as all of them had exclaimed their relief. 

The girl continued to treat the crowd, healing whatever illness or ailment had plagued them. She didn’t seem troubled at all, apart from the people kneeling down in gratitude, as she went through all of them. She simply gave them a gentle smile as her hair shook with the wind.

The crowd had long dispersed and only the two of them remained, she sat on a bench while he watched over her. They were saying something to each other but stopped when they noticed us walking over to them. 

“Oh\!” She clapped her hands. “I saw you two watching from the crowd earlier.” Seeing her up front she looked to be the same age as me, maybe a bit older.

“I’m afraid we are currently taking a break.” The young man said.

“Don’t be like that Leon, I’m really fine.” He simply grunted in reply.

“I’m Esther, I’m currently visiting this city. Oh, and I’m fourteen.” I said my perfect introductory line. The man furrowing his eyebrows didn’t bother me at all. 

“She’s still using that introduction?” I could hear Eric mutter behind me before also introducing himself. It was different from how I said it but it would do. 

The girl let out a chuckle, her sweet voice tickled my ears a bit. “My name is Lavenza, I’m currently traveling with this grumpy boy to see the world.” She gestured to the adult-looking boy. “And I’m sixteen”. Her pure white teeth blinded my eyes as she smiled, making me almost shield my eyes. She must have been a noble as I stared at her elegant sense of air.

“Did you want to ask me something, Esther?”

“Have you traveled to a lot of places?” I asked.

“Oh, more than I can count.”

“Have you seen this seed before?” I decided to help out Eric with his appointment.

She held it in her hand giving it a look. “What seed is this?”

“We don’t know.” Eric answered for me.

“You don’t know?” Leon’s eyes narrowed.

“Yeah, but it’s tasty.” Eric demonstrated for us, crunching the seed shell and all.

“A tasty seed?” Lavenza glanced down at the seed in her fingers.

The boy sighed. “Give it.” He put the round seed he got from her. A crunching sound reverberated in his mouth.

“How is it?” Eric said expectantly. 

“It tastes like raisins.” 

“I know right?\! No one seemed to want to try them. Here, I have lots more\!” He pulled out his bag of seeds.

“I could do without the shell though.” 

Lavenza took another seed from the ecstatic Eric. 

“Oh wow\! It really does taste like raisins.” 

“Esther, now you really have to try one.”

“No thanks, you have some bits stuck in your teeth by the way.”

Eric began poking at his teeth as I told him where to put his finger.

“Ha ha\! You two really make a funny pair.”

“Really?” I couldn’t see the connection.

“Oh I know\!” She said, “Let’s be friends\!”

And so Lavenza and I became friends with the healing girl and her taciturn guard. We chatted while I sat with her while the two boys stood. They seemed to surprisingly vibe well together as Leon began showing off his sword. 

“Lavenza, you seem like a powerful healer.” I asked her. 

“I don’t think I’m that impressive.” She stared in front of her. “I just try my best.”

“Has your healing not worked before?” 

“It hasn't. Why are you asking?” 

I pulled off the glove on my left hand letting it feel the cool air for the first time in a while. Her mouth opened a little and I could see Leon twitch his forehead a little standing there with Eric, he didn’t react. 

It was expected as the flesh squirming around my once-crushed fingers were bulging like waves with circles in its epicenter. My marred hand really looked disgusting as I tried fully bending my fingers. It felt like nails stabbing into it when my bend reached its full potential. I wanted to fix my hand, if not for my mom’s sake. I could still remember how she looked when she saw my disfigured hand for the first time.

“Do you think you can heal my hand? I have three silvers if you want.” It was beyond low for employing a priest or a mage who could heal, still it was all I had right now.

“Don’t you worry Esther.” She held my hand. “I will try my best, no, I *will* do my best\! We’re friends\!”. 

She began focusing and a golden circle appeared over my left hand, the circle looked familiar. And after a while, nothing happened. No bright lights, no nothing. 

“Huh? What’s happening?” I didn’t really get my hopes up.

“Let me try again.” Nevertheless, I felt a bit disappointed as I saw the golden circle appear again. I already knew healing magic didn’t work this body.

“It’s fine, Lavenza.” I quickly put my glove back on. “I expected the outcome.”

“Esther, let me try once-”

“It’s fine.” I stood up from the bench.

“It was fun talking to you two, but it’s getting late, we better take our leave now.” The sun had begun dipping in the sky, making the towering clock tower cast a long  shadow across the ground. 

“Esther, wait-”

“Let’s meet again should the opportunity rise.” I began walking.

Eric was apologizing or something before I heard his brisk footsteps come up behind me. I continued walking while he followed.

“Esther, are you okay?”

“I’m fine.”

“Where are we going?”

“I don’t know.”

“Can you wait for a moment?”

“...”

“Esther, please stop walking.” I felt something grab my hand.

“Let go\!” I yanked my arm back, facing him. It hurt.

“Please talk to me, Esther.” He had a stupid expression plastered on his face.

“What’s wrong?”

“I don’t know\!” I shot back at him. I didn’t know what part of my body that hurt.

“Let’s just calm down, okay?”

“Shut up\!”

I glared at him, glared at his red hair and glared at his brown eyes. Don’t you look at me like that, Eric. 

He took a step toward me. “Breathe, Esther.”

“You’re an idiot\!”

“Yes, I’m an idiot, but you need to breathe, Esther.”

He took another step.

“You’re stupid\!”

“I’m the most stupid person you know, take a deep breath, Esther.”

He put his hand over my eyes, covering them. 

“Just breathe.”

I didn’t want to feel this way

“It hurts…” 

“I know.”

“I was really scared…”

“You’re safe now.”

I stood there while Eric continued to shield my eyes. He didn’t say anything as I felt myself calm down. We must have been standing there for a while.

“*Sniffle*.”

“Have you calmed down?” I could taste something salty sliding down my face as it fell into my mouth.

“*Hic*, Yeah…”

My body shook from the sudden hiccups.

“Can I move my hand now?”

“Not yet…”

It felt calming not being able to see anything.

“I was going to give this to you earlier but so much happened.” I could hear him take something out of his bag.

“I’m gonna move my hand now okay?”

I stayed silent as my eyes took in the bright light outside. A mass of yellow petals bloomed in front of my eyes.

“My mom said they represent strong bonds.”

Yellow alstroemerias.

“Did you get one from Karrie too?”

It smelled disgustingly sweet. I felt my mind go blank.

# Chapter 13: Lavenza

“You are probably wondering why the Buddha said life is suffering right?”

I was about to put the piece of tofu in my mouth. “No?”

“Well, let me tell you a story.”

There once was a zen master who was praised by his neighbors as a person living a pure life. In his neighborhood was a beautiful girl living with her parents. One day, without any warning, they discovered that she was with child. This made her parents furious. She would not say who the man was, but after much shouting and tears, finally said a name, Hakuin, the zen master. In great anger the parents went to the master. 

“Is that so?” Was all that he would say. 

The girl had a successful birth and the child was brought to Hakuin, by this time he had lost all his reputation, which did not trouble him. But he took very good care of the child, he obtained milk from his neighbours, and everything else the little one needed.

A year later the young mother could not tolerate it any longer. She told her parents the truth, that the real father of the child was a young man working in the fish market. The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask his forgiveness, to apologize at length and to get the child back again. Hakuin was willing. In yielding the child all he said was:

“Is that so?”

The monk finished his story. “Did you understand?”

I picked up a piece of sauteed mushroom. “Not really.”

“Hmm”, the monk hummed. “Is that so?”

\*\*\*  
I woke up laying in bed, did I pass out? Where’s Eric? I looked around and saw that it was the inn we had rented. My mom was sleeping on a chair by the bedside. This situation felt very familiar. Once again, I had made my mom sleep in that uncomfortable position. Sorry.

She opened her eyes as I fumbled around on the bed. 

“Oh, are you okay?” She immediately began fretting over me, she took my temperature with the back of her hand. 

“Good, no fever.” She nodded to herself.

“Mom, I feel fine.”

“Sorry Esther, but I really don’t believe you right now.” She looked concerned. 

“Who knows what would have happened if Eric wasn’t with you? Do you know how shocking it was when we saw him carrying you?” She patted my head. 

“What happened?” 

“Where’s Eric?” I saw my gloves on the nightstand.

“He left saying he had to go with his mother.” I see. “They left yesterday for Barre.”

“Yesterday? What about the magic gate?” I needed to get ready quickly.

“Don’t you worry, we are extending our stay for another night.”

“I’m sorry…”

“Hush, you did nothing wrong.” She held me in her bosom. It felt nice.

“Can you tell me what happened? Eric didn’t say much.”

“What did he say?”

“Just that he was ‘sorry’, did he do something to you?”

“Do you really think Eric would do something?”

“He seems like a good boy.”

“He is.”

I told her what had happened yesterday. How I coincidentally met Eric, how we went around the city and found an interesting pair that we befriended. 

“... I don’t remember what happened afterwards.” I lied to her.

“Really?” She seemed surprised about something.

“What is it?”

“I can’t believe my sweet daughter is already experiencing love\!” She looked exceedingly happy.

“What do you mean?” Love?

“You went on a date with Eric through the city\!”

“It wasn’t a date…”

“Sure it was. It sounded lovely too.”

“Mom, it wasn’t like that.”

“Did you have fun?”

Did I have fun? I thought back on my memories. It had been fun until I, uh… got angry.

“Come here, there’s no need to be embarrassed.” She nuzzled against me.

“Should I tell your father?”

“Mom, it wasn't a date.”

Father had at first also looked concerned when he saw me laying in bed. But mom told him what happened yesterday and he got concerned for another reason. 

“That rascal…”

“Oh hush, he seems like a good boy.” 

“I need to talk with him when we get back.” I need to change the subject.

“What happened to the magic gate?”

“Oh right”, my dad remarked, “we are leaving tomorrow morning. So you just rest for today, I’m grounding you.

“What?” 

“Who knows what would have happened to you if that rascal weren’t with you? We can’t have you sleeping on some boy’s back again. I don’t think I can have that scene happen again…”

“Your father is just worried about your health, sweetie.” Mom said as he scratched his chin.

She pulled out a book. “I bought you a souvenir.” 

“The memoirs in the capital.” It was a book written like a someone’s diary detailing the most popular spots one had to see. 

“This looks expensive…”

“You are supposed to say thank you.” Dad said.

I smiled. “Thanks mom, I love it\!”

I had read halfway through the book when my mom entered the room. The morning sun was now at its apex.

“Esther, are you expecting guests?”

“I don’t think so?”

“They look like the people you described earlier.”

How did they find me? Luckily my pyjamas had been changed earlier making me look well dressed enough to stroll the streets. Mom had insisted that even when loafing in the room all day, one should still clothe themselves. 

Sitting at a table 

The inn doubled as both a place to sleep and to eat. On the second floor, guests could use the numerous rooms all lined up by the walls. And on the first floor, food could be ordered from the quaint diner. The innkeeper and his wife were the only two working the inn.

“What are you two doing here?” I asked the pair that sat at one of the tables. 

“Oh, what did I tell you, Leon? It was her mother.” Lavenza turned to the boy opposite her seat who just let out a small exhale.

“How did you know?” I could feel my mom peeking from the second floor as I took a seat, joining their table. Lavenza turned to her direction then back at me. 

“You too look exactly the same\!” She chirped happily. “Leon, look again\!”

“Lavenza, you are being rude again.”

“Oh.”

“So what are you two doing here, I don’t think I told you where I was staying at.”

“Eric told us to visit.”

She explained that after carrying me back, he had found the two of them strolling the markets telling them I got sick.

“Are you fine now? You left so abruptly yesterday…” Her eyes looked at the cup in her hands. “It’s my fault isn’t it?”

“What do you mean?”

“You looked fine before I tried to use healing magic. Did you become unwell from that?”

In some sense it did, however the real reason was that my emotions had run rampant. I don’t really understand why I reacted that way, it just did. It didn’t feel good.

“I feel fine now.”

“I knew it. I can’t believe my powers could make someone sick. I’m so sorry, Esther...” She bowed her head.

Shivers went down my spine when I saw the two of them apologize, Leon also had also bent his head. This must be how Lavenza felt when seeing the kneeling people.

“You shouldn’t bow your head that easily”, I said. “Aren’t you a noble?”

Did they really need to look that dumbfounded? “How did you know?”

“It was obvious with your appearance”, I turned to Leon. “You even have a bodyguard protecting you.” 

Nobles never traveled alone, my dad had said. It was to flaunt to the commoners that they were worth more. My mother argued back that they had to travel in a group because there were many angry and dangerous people willing to do anything, especially to noblewomen. My mom looked uncharacteristically angry when she told him that, to which my dad had to reluctantly accept defeat.

Lavenza looked flustered and Leon just sighed.

“It hasn’t even been that long before I got caught…”

“Do I have to call you Lady Lavenza now?” It rolled off nicely off the tongue.

“Ah\! Don’t even think about it\! Just call me like you usually do.”

“Yes, my lady.” I couldn’t help but chuckle seeing her blushing face.

“You’re surprisingly nonchalant about this, Esther”, Leon said. “Commoners are typically afraid to talk to nobles.”

“The noble ruling our town happens to be a decent person. You can often spot him in town talking to the townspeople.”

“Really? That’s unusual…”, Lavenza added. 

“Oh, that’s right. My father is also a noble.” The two of them looked stunned. Nice I even managed to get Leon.

“Which makes me a noble too. I think.” 

Lavenza was about to open her mouth when the door to the inn creaked open. It was my dad.

“Are you out and walking about, Esther?” He walked up to our table. “You must be my daughter’s new friends, please take good care of her.” A handsome smile appeared in front of us. I didn’t really notice this but he was rather tall, standing half a head higher than even the tall Leon. His forearm muscles bulged, showing off well-defined veins as he held a bag. It looked heavy.

They turned to me, unsure what to say in this situation. I just put my finger in front of my mouth.

“A-ah, yes\! We will make sure to do that.” Her voice pitched weirdly.

“Of course”, Leon took a pause in his sentence, “sir.”

“Haha, you befriended some energetic kids again.” He patted my head. “Well, let me make myself scarce, you guys have fun.” The stairs creaked under the combined weight of my dad and his bag full of stuff. 

Silence filled the room where only the three of us used. The other guests had already started their day or were sleeping in. 

“What\!?” Lavenza exclaimed. “You’re a noble too?”

“My father is a noble. I found out about a week ago.”

“So the reason you are visiting the capital is…”

“Yup, we're going to visit my grandfather.”

“Sounds complicated…” Lavenza threw herself over the table. “It’s not easy being a noble. I just want to have fun and travel”, she babbled.

“Interesting”, Leon said, “Is Eric a noble too?”

“Not everyone from our town is secretly a noble, you know?”

“Funny hearing that from you.”

Lavenza pulled herself back up. “Do we have to call you Lady Esther now too?”

“That sounds nice, I would prefer that.”

“I would rather not…”

“You can call me whatever you want, Lady Lavenza.”

“Stop calling me that\!”

The two of them had initially wanted to just check up on me, however it had gotten pretty late when we finally found pause in our chatting. My mom suggested we eat together, she wanted to thank the guests for entertaining my day.

The diner was now filled up with dozens of people making the air in here a bit stifled but warm. It felt cozy in the late winter temperature. Mrs. Innkeeper was busily going to and fro deftly weaving between the tables and customers alike, in her hands dozens of dishes were stacked as she swooped up the empty plates and placed new ones in one motion. The steam coming from the dishes cooked by Mr. Innkeeper smelt delicious. 

“So you got grounded?” Lavenza asked while neatly spooning some steaming soup. Leon, sitting beside her, grabbed some bread with his hands and chomped on it, letting out a crispy crunching sound.

My mom told them that I was often feeling unwell and had to rest adequately. I had to spare some energy for the trip tomorrow.

“Wow, a magic gate. You should look forward to it, it's pretty amazing\!”

“You have used one before?” My dad asked.

“O-oh, I read about it in a book\!”

“A book huh? Did you learn to read at the church?”

“The church?”

“You have healing powers right?” Mom answered instead. “Thank you for using it on our daughter, I don't know how to repay you.”

“It was nothing\! Besides, it didn't work…”

“I see”, dad remarked. “She must have shown you two. Thank you for still accepting her.” My dad looked sad.

“She’s been a good friend to us”, Leon said, nodding his head.

“Ho ho, you two really are respectful. Are you perhaps-”

My mom smacked my fathers arm, sending him a silent stare before turning to them.

“You two must still be hungry, here have some more, doesn’t it taste better the more people there are?”

“It really does\!” Lavenza nodded enthusiastically.

With the plates wiped clean and ample time had passed, Lavenza and Leon took their leave. She promised to say hello the next time we met and gave me her handkerchief. It felt soft beneath my gloves and a crest was embroidered in the corner. I wondered what house she came from as I waved back at her shrinking image. Leon didn’t even look back once.

It was finally time as I checked my pocketbook. Money, check. Lucky charm, check. Seeds from Eric, check. Half-eaten piece of bread, check. I threw that piece of bread as far as I could between the trees. Now I had to turn my pocketbook upside down to get all the stupid crumbs out.

We stood in line waiting our turn to use the magic gate. I could hear it wobble as the surface of the building sized mirror warbled. It looked like the surface of a lake if something constantly disturbed it. 

“Name?” One of the magicians asked.

“Gale.”

“Last name?”

My dad went up to him and showed the token he had received from Raviel. It ensured anonymity and was only used by a select few high-ranking nobles.

“R-right this way, sir\!”

“Want to hold my hand, Esther?” Mom reached out her hand which I accepted.

“It should feel like taking a swim, no need to be worried.”

“But dad”, I said. 

“I’ve never taken a swim before.”

“Oh right.”

I felt something push me as my body fell forwards into the shimmering surface.

“See you on the other side\!” I heard my dad say.

# Chapter 14: The estate

Countless people streamed across the narrow sidewalks as the sun peeked between the tall buildings, casting a cool shadow across the double-wide road. The road was laid with cobblestones, making the carriages rattle as they passed each other by. I could feel my back being stroked as I forced myself to describe more things I saw out of the carriage.

My father sat on our side crossing his arms. “At least you had the forethought to send a carriage without a family crest.”

“Of course, I personally witnessed your temperament last time.” Raviel sat opposite of us, her back against the driver’s seat. The seats may be a little small for two adults and sitting together, yet this was the best configuration we decided.

Duke Nikodemus, my grandfather, had sent Raviel to pick us up at the magic gate station. Her hair had grown a bit longer, it now reached to her shoulders. She had exchanged her usual bow and pants for a simple but elegant dress. It flowed softly downwards only stopping once it reached her ankles. Hadn’t it been for the colors, I would have thought she wore one of those maid outfits.

No one said anything in the carriage, only sounds of the wooden wheels hitting the cobblestone entertained our whole way to our destination. We were going to finally meet the patriarch, Gregor Nikodemus. My mothers hand trembled as she continued to stroke my back. 

We crossed a large gate where a guard confirmed Raviel’s identity, giving her a little bow. Behind the gate stood a paved path sandwiched by two large swathes of bushes and trees. A gazebo could be seen on the right side.

The rows of bushes converged together letting the Estate stand centerpoint, it looked magnificent, several times bigger than our inn we had lodged at for two days. A friendly looking gentleman was waiting on the stairs for us with several other maids and servants lined up behind him. They went immediately to work upon our arrival, unloading our luggage.

My father opened the carriage door, slipping in the refreshing air much to my delight, before taking confident steps out of the carriage. Mom followed suit, gracefully grasping his outstretched hand and escorted herself down. It looked natural as the two of them now stood at attention before the servants. Then it was my turn. Like a sack of potatoes, my father grabbed me by the sides and lifted me down with a childlike plop. Wow.

“Welcome back Lord Galen. I see that you are still in good health.” The butler-like man greeted, crow’s feet forming at the corners.

“Thank you Alden, but I’m not a lord anymore so there’s no need for you to bow your head at me.”

“You will always be a lord of this house, allow me this once to pay my respects.”

“Lift your head, Alden.”

“Just this once, my lord.” The two of them were stubborn each in their own ways as neither relented. Mom stepped forward to break it up.

“I see you too are in good health, Lady Victoria” My ears tickled hearing her title.

“It has been a while, sir Alden.” She did the same thing as Raviel a few days prior. Lifting the hem of her dress and bending a leg backward. It looked like a useful movement to learn.

His elderly face turned to me. “You must be the young miss.” 

I mirrored the curtsy my mom had done. “Hello, my name is Esther. I’m fourteen.”

“Goodness, fourteen? Has it really been that long?” He bent his knee making it easier for me to look at him. “Welcome to the Nikodemus estate”, his teeth were really white, “we hope you enjoy your stay here.”

The carpet adorning the halls were really squishy. It was like walking on clouds or deflated air mattresses. Squish, squish, it felt weird. We were being led down a long hall by the butler. Candles lit the walls and chandeliers lit the ceiling. 

“It’s a shame that Lord Gilbert and Lady Grace aren't here to keep you company.” I heard my mom let out a sigh beside me.

“Alden.” My father stopped walking. “I’m only here for one purpose, just take me to my father.”

“Of course my lord, my age must be showing today. Here, this door.” Honestly, it looked more like a gate. Two doors, no doubt heavier than the carriage we rode on, sat flush in the wall. Their height could be measured using three of myselves, if I stood on my toes. A symbol of the family crest was engraved on each of the doors. The duke was represented by a rose, thorns still on its stem.

“Still using the same room I see.” My father went on to grab the golden door handles when the butler stopped him. 

“I must ask that only you meet with his Grace.” 

My father squinted at him. “And why is that?” 

“He asked for your understanding.”

“That’s rich coming from him.”

“It sounds important, dear. We can just find somewhere to relax. Can you find us a place to rest, sir Alden?”

“Of course my Lady, please follow me.”

My father was left for himself as I followed my mom. The gigantic doors seemed to swallow him as he went inside. A loud clack resounded in the hall behind me.

“Thank you for swiftly solving the situation again.” He gave a little bow while opening the door to another room. The insides were huge. Chairs and tables, that’s right, multiple tables decorated the clean wooden floor.  

“I didn’t do it for you”, my mom said. “I just want to get out here as fast as possible.” She closed the door on Alden.

\*\*\*  
Galen went into the room and saw his father sitting at the same couch he always sat on. It had become worn by the passage of time, fraying at the seams and showing the stitching underneath. A bunch of documents lay spread over the low-raised tea table. Like small black ants, words filled the off-white pages. Hearing the door to his office open and close, the Duke still didn’t stop inspecting the document in his hand.

“You are late.” It was a rough and gruff voice befitting someone in his position. Galen wondered if it had become even deeper than before.

“Good to see you too, your Grace”. Galen stood in front of the tea table, hands behind his back like a soldier standing at attention. His father had gotten older. Gray hairs dotted here and there on the otherwise black mane. “Why did you call for me?”

“You were supposed to arrive last week.” Was it that important whether or not he had arrived on time? For years, they hadn’t seen each other and the first thing he mentioned meeting him was ‘You are late’, incredible. 

“I will take my leave if you don’t tell-” 

“Your mother has fallen in an accident. She’s in a coma.”

The words coming from his father were unexpected, it didn’t even register in his head. 

“What?” Sure, he hadn’t asked about the whereabouts of his mother or how she was doing. He could just visit her after this meeting, visit her with his lovely daughter. Seeing Alden not behave that differently from usual, Galen had not given it any more thoughts. 

“She may not have that long left.” The Duke’s voice trembled as he delivered the news. It was the first time he saw his father’s figure look like that. His father, one of the most powerful men in the kingdom, one of the most strict men he knew of, and one who never showed as much a sliver of emotion, sat there looking sad. His permanently straight line of a mouth had broken into a frown. He looked small on his worn out couch.

“And when did this accident happen?” 

“A week ago, or two now that you are finally here.” What was that supposed to mean? Nothing was said in the letter, only the words ‘come home’ was written on it. It was maddening. He wouldn’t have delayed the trip this much if he had known. He had wasted away a week of his mother’s life all because this man didn’t deem it important enough to write down some damn details. 

“Why didn’t you say that in the letter?” Galen practically growled.

“Take a seat, we have much to go through.” The aging man simply straightened out the documents on the table. Giving them three taps on the table. Tap, tap, tap. 

“I would have come as fast as I could had you just written that\! Do you know how much time I wasted\!” Guilt, betrayal. Those two feelings clashed against each other in his heart. 

Garius slammed his fist on the table making the perfectly straightened documents jump a little. “Take. A. Seat.”

“How am I to look at some damned piece of papers right now\! What even are these?\!” He picked up the nearest document on the table. “Is this her inheritance?\!” Galen’s voice got louder for each new sentence he said.

But the next words from his father trumped even that, booming in the room, even penetrating out into the hall and the neighboring rooms. 

“Yes they are\!” Garius Nikodemus stood up. 

“Laying there unconscious in her bed\! She had written this piece of paper to prepare for a day like this\!” 

Grabbing his collar, he was screaming in the face of his son, his youngest son, his son that had forsaken his own name. Galen could do naught but look at his out of control father. He looked down at the man that had raised him, he looked down. His father had gotten shorter in the years he had been gone.

“To her most ungrateful\! And insane child\!”

\*\*\*  
It was delicious, I had to take another piece. A maid had come in with some tea and refreshments. A plate of cookies looking like small checkerboards sat in front of me. Crumbs fell to the table like sand as I grabbed another one. 

“Are they good?” My mom stared at me stuffing the cookies in my mouth. It was rude to talk with food in one’s mouth, her question got answered with a nod instead.

“Maybe I should call for another plate.”

“Really?” She seemed to sparkle more than usual today.

“Of course\! Your mother used to live here a long, long time ago, you know?”

“Why did you leave?” They had soft floors and cookies.

“Oh… How about we tell you when we get home again?” 

“You don’t need to tell me if you don’t want to.” I don’t like complicated things. 

“You’re not curious?”

I shook my head. “You two always get sad whenever you talk about it.”

She smiled. “My sweet and lovely daughter, I pray that you are always happy and healthy\!” She gave me a hug. I could see some crumbs falling onto her dress as she nuzzled up against me.

True to her word, a new plate of cookies had been delivered to us. The maid gave me a gentle smile as she excused herself out of the room with the polished empty ceramic plate. These ones tasted a bit different, earthy like bread with bits of sweetness. 

Flat on the bottom and dome shaped, they sat on the palm of my hand. It had pieces of grain sticking out of where I had chomped onto it and black colored dots adding the otherwise brown cookie a bit of color. Raisin’s were not on the top of my list of foods, still who knows when this much sugar would present itself in front of me ever again? It had to at least be a year on my next birthday.

“Are we leaving after father is done with his meeting?” I munched on the last cookie.

“If all goes well.” My mother was sipping her second cup of tea. The cups were different from ours at home, they were shorter and had handles. Letting her little finger fly, she held it with the remaining fingers. It looked a bit silly.

“Will I be able to meet my grandfather?” It was hard holding the cup like that. My fingers cramped immediately.

“I think we have to, however, you should refer to him as his Grace or your grace while we’re here.” My mom taught me the basics of etiquette while traveling. It was interesting and fun hearing the countless small rules, faux pas was what I had just said, she called it. “Although I don’t think your father wants you to meet with him.” 

“Does he hate his Grace?”

She put down her cup with a soft clink. “It’s hard to say.”

“What about her Grace, can I meet her?”

“That should be doable, I actually want to meet her again too\!” Mom must really like my grandmother to smile like that. “Let’s ask your father after he is done talking.”

It had been some time since we were escorted here. Eating all the cookies had made me feel a bit drowsy. I should have just slept in hindsight.

The door opened and my father took a step in. With swift steps, my mom quickly got up and held his face in her hands. It was happening again.

“Gale, what happened? What did you talk about?”

“Victoria…” He sounded hoarse.

“Yes I’m here.” He laid his head on her shoulder.

“My mother is dying…” The room was silent.

“Three years left, they said…”

“That can’t be…” My mother’s voice trembled. 

“We have to stay here until…”

Why was this always happening?

“...until my mother wakes up.”

“That can’t be…” My mom lost the strength in her legs. It was like a pull-string doll that used all of its rope. 

“I’m sorry.”

Why couldn’t we just be happy? This life and that life, bad luck seemed to follow me wherever I was.

I didn’t know who was consoling whom as my father carried her to the couch. My eyes burned as something wet rolled down my face.

# Chapter 15: Grandfather

“This is your room Miss, do you have any questions?”

The room was as large as our house in Barre. It had a big bed, a big closet and a big mirror over the desk. Long blond hair and puffy blue eyes. I had gotten used to seeing this face whenever something shiny reflected it, however today it looked completely bizarre.

The garden sat outside the big window situated on the third floor. Patches of grass were beginning to sprout turning the lawn green. In between the square and circle bushes, some flowers were looking up at me. The flowy curtains did a fine job of blocking them off.

“I can use everything in here?”

The maid had her hands folded above her apron-dress. Black and white, it was pretty. “That’s right.”

“Even the clothes?” Swiping my finger across the table surface, not a single speck of dust stuck to my glove.

“Those may be a bit large for you.”

“I see.” It was cold. Even with the countless rays of sun lighting up this huge room big enough to fit four of my old rooms, it was cold. 

“Can you remove these flowers for me?” The maid assigned to guide me paused for a second. 

“Of course, Miss.” With a swift hand, the flowers on the circular table got removed, vase and all.

“Thank you, that’ll be all.” She excused herself and left me alone in the huge room.

Drawing the other curtains made it dimmer. At least the bed felt comfortable enough, making my body sink down in the mattress as the soft duvet wrapped around me. “Ha…” A sigh found itself escaping.

My parents had a room for themselves on the left wing of the Estate, mine was on the right. I wonder how my mom was doing, maybe I could try to cheer her up. Willing my body to move was futile. It didn’t budge an inch, merely staying still in the prison that was the bed, chaining me to sleep.

Spread in front of me were several knives, forks and spoons. All in different sizes and shapes. A knife had a blunt edge, effective for spreading soft things like the butter placed in front of me. While another knife had a serrated edge, whose small teeth would be effective against cutting up pieces of flesh. They glistened as the embroidery caught the chandelier light.

At the head of the table sat my grandfather, Duke Nikodemus. To his right, my father and mom. I sat opposite of her, making the seat between the Duke and I empty.

Servants and maids stationed by the wall began setting out our food. A steaming bowl of red soup stared into me, its pleasant aroma tickling my hungry nose. My spoon stopped approaching the soup when a cough came from my mom. Ah, the Duke hadn’t started eating yet.

A new dish replaced my bowl of soup. Amazing. You get to eat twice in one sitting? Soup had been easy enough, a single spoon had been placed among the numerous utensils, but this was a steak. Which fork should I use? The one with three tips, four tips or the rare five-tipped fork? I copied what my mom was doing.

Rub, rub. The thick piece of meat sitting on my plate slid around in the sauce, painting the whole porcelain plate brown. Cutting it had been no problem, but my left hand couldn’t anchor the steak properly. I couldn’t press my fork down hard enough. Rub, rub, it slid each time I moved my knife. Rub, rub, rub– My plate disappeared. A new one with an already cut up piece of flesh presented itself to me. My father had swapped our plates.

“Tsk, she doesn’t even know how to use a fork and knife. What have you been teaching her?”

“We have been teaching her the important things in life”, my father replied.

“And knowing how to eat like a civilized person is not important?”

He put down his utensils with enough force to make the porcelain ring. “What, and knowing how to use a fork in a lofty way makes one civilized?"

“Hah\! Keep spoiling her like that and regret is all you will get. And what’s up with that glove of hers.” Mom looked at me with a sad expression. “Never have I ever seen such rude table manners.”

After dinner, I went around to explore the estate. Like a museum, several paintings hung on the walls in the halls, in the rooms that weren’t locked, and even in the bathrooms. There was one particular painting that took my attention, rooting me on the spot. 

A grotesque figure with a hunched back and gray wild hair was taking a bite out of another person. A soft red color streamed down from the bitten body and instead of a satisfied expression, the grotesque being was painted to be horrified and disgusted. Its eyes were staring at me.

“An interesting painting isn’t it?” The sudden question made my shoulders jump a little. It was the Duke speaking beside me. “A personal friend of mine painted this.”

“Are there other paintings here made by them?” I wanted to see more.

“No, this is the only one he left with me.” 

My grandfather was neatly dressed in a suit standing with a straight posture. Whether it was the lighting or not, his sunken eyes made him look tired. Neither smiling nor frowning, he stared at the painting I had admired. Oh, I forgot to greet him. The peculiar atmosphere, a result of me missing my timing, made me hold my silence. 

I had always wondered why the monks at the temple liked to hang up these kinds of paintings, they looked similar to each other, paintings of demons and the like. Seeing this painting opposite of the giant doors, an answer reared itself in my mind. It was a mirror, a painting of yourself.

“Why do you think I had this painting hung up in front of my office?”

“As a reminder, your Grace”

He paused. “Interesting. I haven’t heard that answer before. Make time for tomorrow, your clothes look too shabby.”

I stood in front of a mirror double my size. Did it really have to be that tall? It made my already average height look much shorter than it really was. My mom standing behind me was a whole head taller than me. I wonder if there will be steak tomorrow too.

A seamstress flitted around me, taking my dimensions with a string as she made me spin around while lifting my arms up and down. I was a doll today. Excited chatter filled the room as her assistant took note of my numbers. 

“Golden hair and azure blue eyes, I think this design fits her the best.” She held a drawing of a dress in her hand. The skirt bloomed outwards stopping a bit below the knees. A design intended for young ladies like me, she said. It looked pretty.

“But what about this one?” Her assistant showed another drawing. This one had more frills and a longer skirt, stopping at the ankles. It also looked pretty.

“Assistant\! What should we do?” She picked up the dozen drawings. “Everything fits her perfectly\!” Why did it feel like she was more enthusiastic about this than me? It was getting noisy as the two of them debated on which drawing was the best. More bows, less frills. It all looked pretty, no?

“Which one do you like the most, sweetie?” Mom had also gotten a makeover, sporting a new elegant dress. She looked in her element as it flowed nicely on her tall figure. “I think this one would look cute on you\!” She picked the one with the knee-length skirt and ribbons.

“Ah\! Lady Victoria\!” The seamstress yelled.

“W-what is it?” My mother’s hands were seized.

“That’s right\! How could we forget\! Assistant, pick out all the cutest ones\!”

My new dress bounced up and down whenever I kicked my legs, creating soft ripples across the white fabric. Ripple, ripple, the frills frilled this way and that way. 

The seamstress also gave me a new pair of gloves which fit snugly like a glove, or like the stockings I currently wore. A plate of cookies was served to me as I sat with my mom in the gazebo in the garden. She was taking a nap while still holding a cookie in her hands.

Even as the sounds of clashing and roars shook the otherwise calm afternoon, she didn’t drop it. Going on an investigation, I found myself looking on at a dozen knights training with their shirts off. The glistening sweat dripping from their toned muscles flew off each time they roared and swung their cold hard steel swords. Surrounding the training area were several tribunes, making it easy to hide myself.

“Look over there man, there’s some kid watching us.”

“Kid? There’s no kid in the estate, just focus on your breathing.” The young man sitting on the ground pointed in my area. 

“Over there, she’s just crouching there.” They had sharper eyesight than I thought.

The other man went up to me and with the raised tribunes, made him look up at me. It felt weird not having to crane my neck to look at someone’s face. 

“Little lady? What are you doing here?” His green hair reminded me of Finn.

“She’s obviously here to cheer us on\! Isn’t that right?” The other one had brown-orange hair and freckles.

“How heavy is that?” I pointed to the sword on his hip.

“Do you want to try to hold it?” Freckles said.

“Hey, what are you saying to her?”

“Here grab the hilt, be careful not to fall over the wall.”

It was surprisingly light. His comment about falling had made me expect something else, but with a single hand I effortlessly managed to point the tip towards the sky. Swoosh, swoosh, I did some overhead swings like they had done earlier.

“Hmm, surprisingly good form.” Green hair said.

“Now try to do this\!” Freckles showed me a move with his empty hands. Like? The sword cut through the air.

“Haha\! You got talent for this little miss\!”

“What are you two fools fooling around here for?” A man went up to them.

“Commander, look how this little lady is swinging the sword\!”

“What nonsense, why should I—” I did the same move.

“Hmm… not bad.” The man rubbed his moustache. It twirled above his mouth in two neat circles.

“However, who in the hell had the thought to give such a young lady a real sword\!” The commander gave the two of them a swift kick to their behind. “Go back to your post\!” Rubbing their butts, the two of them staggered back to the middle.

“My apologies for my men behaving towards you in this way, they are quick to learn but still young.” He gave me a neat bow.

“Why are you being so respectful to me?”

“You’re lady Esther are you not?” I liked the sound of that. “It’s hard to find someone with such brilliant hair in the duchy. Makes me remember the times when I trained your father.”

“You trained him?”

“Hah\! We were practically brothers in arms back in the day.”

“Really?”

“He hasn’t told you?” He looked a bit sad.

“My father doesn’t talk much about his past.”

The commander rubbed his moustache again. “I see, considering what happened… Nevermind. What are you doing over here?”

“It was interesting. And loud.”

“Loudness is the primary source of our energy after all\!” He bellowed. I wonder if I could be that loud after some training. The drops of sweat forming on my forehead and the clammy feeling in my gloves made me think otherwise. 

“One hundred more swings\!” He ordered his men. 

“Yes sir\!” And a hundred swings they did. 

I observed them until a servant came and fetched me. My parents were sitting together, relaxing for the first time in a while. 

“We have decided to get you a personal maid.”

# Chapter 16: Maid

Alice found herself in the ducal house of Nikodemus and couldn’t hide the joy in her step as she opened the door to the parlor. She had been promoted from being a normal maid to a personal maid\! 

No more cleaning rickety old furniture, no more climbing shaky ladders and best of all, no more doing laundry\! Oh, the joys of life, she rubbed her chapped hands together praying to the goddess. Thank you\!

Would she be serving the pretty lady that had moved in recently? The duchess was still laying in her coma. She shuddered at the thought of the old woman. The goddess must be watching over this household for her to survive such a nasty fall.

Knock, knock. A pretty bird-like voice answered for her to come in. This was it, she would befriend this noble lady and reap all of the benefits of being her personal maid. Her friend in a neighboring noble house would always brag about her jewellery and dresses and desserts. Oh, to be poor. 

Sitting on a chair, kicking her short legs, was a pretty blond person. Her expensive looking dress fluttered and the aura of a noble could be felt from her still face. A child. This wasn’t Lady Victoria, it was her child. 

There must have been a mistake. One by one, Alice felt her bubbles of dreams pop in order. Shopping trips where she would get free clothes? Pop. Tea parties where beautiful ladies gathered and gossiped? Pop. Balls and banquets where handsome rich men would all gather? Pop. Promotion? She would rather be kicked if it meant she didn’t have to babysit a weird girl all the time\!

She had at first been interested in the child as there were none in this place. Sneaking glances whenever she had the chance, she observed her. Walking around without reason and looking at whatever was in front of her, she gawked at every little thing. And the amount of sweets that little girl ate. 

Alice could feel her stomach turn in jealously. It was an unwritten rule to not finish the plates of refreshments as the leftovers would be shared among the staff, but each time, without fail, she polished the heaps of sweets. Her irritation grew as another memory surfaced.

The morning that sir Alden had announced that guests would come, she had taken a lot of time to prepare the rooms. Even asking the chatty gardener for some flowers to decorate them. 

‘Please remove them.’ Agh\! She wanted to tear her own hair after hearing that. She didn’t even comment on them, hell, she didn’t even change her face. The same face that had been plastered on her as if a statue for the past few days. Her blue eyes were staring. At what? Alice was about to turn her head when she suddenly moved. 

“Good morning, my name is Esther and I am fourteen.”

She had initiated a conversation first with a peculiar greeting, something resembling a curtsy she did. As expected from her appearance, her voice carried an angelic air about it. A high pitch, yet not that high to be grating on the ears, but it sounded bored, or dead. She had to suppress the sigh trying to escape while observing the moody girl.

“Greetings my lady, my name is Alice and I will be your personal maid from this day forward. Please speak comfortably to me.” She clicked her imaginary tongue.

“I see.”

“...”

That was it? ‘I see’, It was impressive how uninterested she was. Hadn’t this girl just been some commoner until recently? Even Alice wanted to have a personal maid of her own that would do all of her biddings. She was just staring at her. Staring with her eerie blue eyes. 

Then she opened her mouth again. “Alice, do you know what a shopping center is?”

“A shopping center? Do you mean the center of the shopping district?” 

“Nevermind, forget what I just said.” 

Not a single other word was uttered before she was dismissed. Standing outside the closed parlor door, she let out the sigh that had grown into a full exhale. Oh, goddess. Is this the punishment for my sins? Wasn’t praying to you for seven straight days enough? Doing laundry would be less tiring than being in the same room as her. Two of her colleagues were busy cleaning the hallway.

“Hey, why do you think that pair is getting such good treatment? I understand that the woman is pretty and that the man is handsome with that chiseled face… But aren’t they just some commoners?”

“Are you silly? That’s the duke’s youngest son you are talking about\!”

“Gasp\! What? The Duke’s youngest? But he’s older than me.”

“You must be one of the never ones.” The maid lent forward and whispered. “From what I’ve heard, he got banished or something from the Duchy a couple years back.”

“What did he do?”

“Not him, that woman he has with him. What do you think?”

“Gosh, you can't mean?”

The other maid puffed out her chest and pointed at the new girl. “You are not fit to be with my son. Get out\!” She mimicked the tone of the Duke, her employer.

“That can’t be, that sounds just like the books\!”

She shrugged. “You didn’t hear it from me.” 

“Oh, Alice.” The two of them saw their promoted friend. “How was the young lady?”

“Could you tell me more about that story? It was interesting.”

Huh, so the only noble among them was the handsome man? So she had been tricked either way? It did sound too unbelievable when she of all the maids had been promoted. Making sure the two maids couldn’t see her, she clenched her teeth and grimaced. Ugly. Someone seeing her face would think that.

The warm water enveloping my body felt nice. Was this how potatoes felt as they were being cooked? Imagining the steaming potatoes somehow made me feel even sleepier. It had honestly been a long week. I got some new pretty clothes, met some of my father's old friends, held a sword for the first time, and even got my own personal maid. To be a steaming potato…

“My lady, you shouldn’t fall asleep in the tub.”

“Ah, sorry…”

“You don’t need to apologize to someone like me.”

Having her help me bathe didn’t bother me as much as I thought. Mom must have accustomed me to this as she always helped me bathe. She was a real professional, didn’t even comment once about my disfigured left hand, applause to her.

Alice’s face was familiar and searching through my memories didn’t help. The first time it happened, I attributed it to pure coincidence. Karrie must have been a special case, one in a million perhaps. But now that it happened twice? 

Another person from my previous life had found themselves involved in my life again with no rhyme nor reason. I would understand if this maid was someone I had killed. ‘Look these are the ones that lost their life because of you’, was that what you wanted to say, Goddess? Sorry, I have not killed this woman. I never forgot their faces.

Thinking about it, who would I like to see again? My imaginary catalogue of people did not contain that many people. Maybe her? Flip. Him? Flip. Ah, I reached the end already. Maybe I should have tried to meet more people– blub, blub.

“Ah, my lady\!”

Three days later, I was set to meet with my grandmother for the first time. The duchess’ room was even larger than my own. Like twice the size. Her sleeping figure looked peaceful laying there surrounded by her family. I blinked a few times as some imaginary flower crests invaded my vision. 

Old, wrinkly. Those descriptors didn’t suit my grandmother. She still looked youthful even with some gray strands on her otherwise black hair. Father looked more like her than the Duke with their long eye lashes. 

“When will she be able to wake up?” My father asked the attending physician.

“We truly do not know, my lord.”

“I’m not a lord.” He crossed his arms. “What about the priests? Don’t tell me it won’t work this time either.”

“That’s why I have been called.”

“Hah, I wonder what those priests can even do.”

“Gale, you know their magic isn’t all powerful”, said mom.

“I expected it to be a little powerful, not all useless.”

“Who knows what the goddess thinks.” The physician agreed with my father. “A sinner can get their arm reattached but a noble person like the Duchess has no other cure besides to wait.”

The three of us left the room, leaving my grandmother to fend for herself with the physician sitting on the edge of blasphemy. 

“How are you finding the estate?” My father asked.

“It’s fun, Alice helps me with a bunch of things.”

“She does look like a lovely girl”, said mom.

“Yeah, it’s fun talking to her.” Although something interesting happened later that day.

Out of curiosity as no one had told me yet what her accident was, I asked Alice about it. 

“The Duchess’ accident? I can’t say I know about it.” Beam\! The golden circle appeared across her mouth. 

“You don’t know about it? I heard it happened two weeks ago.”

“I wasn’t at the estate that day, my apologies.” Another lie. 

Asking the other maids and servants the same questions gave the same result. None of them appeared to know what had happened that day. None of them besides Alice.

Mom tucked me in bed while I grumbled whatever this meant. How come none of them knew what had happened to the second most important person in the duchy? It didn’t make sense.

“What happened to grandmother?” She stared into the air. “The official stance is that she fell down the stairs, but your father and I have a different opinion.” 

“What do you think?”

“That she was pushed.” My mom caressed my hair. “The Duchess isn’t some silly old woman that would fall down the same stairs she had been using for the last couple of decades, you know?”

Was Alice the culprit? Was the reason why she knew about it because she did it? This grumbling feeling must have been how that detective felt as he hunted me down. His scarred eye floated in my mind for a second making me shake my head. A prickling feeling in my abdomen made it hard to fall asleep today. 

I had to find an answer to this. ‘You can’t decide which one to read? Why don’t you flip a coin about it.’, right. Eric did sometimes, rarely though, say some smart nuggets. Heads, she's the culprit, tails, she’s not the culprit.

Crawling out of my comfortable bed I opened the drawer where my pouch was. Nothing. The drawer was empty. My pouch holding my countless coins and my lucky coin was gone. Someone had taken it.

Something glimmered above my head. What was it now? I didn’t have someone to lie to, I didn’t have someone to stab. Why was it appearing now? Instead of a glowing circle, a golden arrow with golden feathers hovered in my view. There was a ribbon tied to it. Two words. Coin pouch was written on it. It pointed towards my bedroom door.

# Chapter 17: Stealing

Killing wasn’t something I particularly enjoyed, it just happened. A feeling, as if something gripped my heart, squeezing it, slowly pressing into it, making the organ feel like exploding. I saw someone microwave their hamster for fun once. Its insides splattered across the glass door and a horrible stench had made them laugh and giggle and chuckle. 

The failure last year must have shocked that feeling out of my body as my heart felt fine besides the time I overexerted myself. I could live this life as the goddess intended, without killing anyone.

I could wake up to my mom greeting me with her gentle smile and father telling a joke or an interesting story. But like our lives will, that feeling came to an end. Today my heart began to suffocate again.

I remember the first time I felt it. Every time on the way back from school, there was something that always caught my attention. It was some old woman sleeping on the ground. Everyday, everytime, just like how the hands on a clock always turned, she was always lying there on that piece of tattered cardboard. The same dirty clothes, the same dirty paper cup and the same disgusting hunched silhouette. 

There was one day when she didn’t sleep there. I felt relieved, it was a miracle. No more would my tiring walk be interrupted by some selfish person thinking the street was their own. I threw away her cardboard. 

The next day, she appeared again. The same dirty clothes, the same dirty paper cup and the same disgusting silhouette greeted me on the way home. She was sleeping on the ground. That was the moment when I felt my heart rip to pieces.

It was remarkable how much better it felt with her gone. Sure, her shocked expression as I jammed a knife in her throat, slashing the carotid making the blood spurt out of her like a fountain, surfaced whenever I slept or ate, studied or went to use the toilet, but that was a small price to pay to protect the only enjoyable time of my day. 

A week after I killed her, Ann pulled me to the side to ask me something.

Seeing Alice’s sleeping visage made me finally remember where I had seen her face before. She was the first person I killed. Her overgrown dirty hair had hidden her face, but that sleeping position would never leave my memory. Is this your doing Goddess? Why do the ones I killed keep appearing before me?

As if begging me, the arrow in my room had hovered in the air with no indication of dimming itself, giving me no chance to sleep even if I wanted to. 

The magic lamps had all been turned off, making the hallway appear endless in the darkness. While following the arrow, I passed several paintings, suits of armor and vases with flowers. It was honestly impressive how each day, a new set of hideous flowers greeted me in the face. 

It was a bit shocking to find out that the place it was pointing to was my personal maid’s room, but the evidence showed itself tucked deep in her closet. There was a whole box of items in there, jewelry, lockets and even a letter. 

I had seen my fair share of these types of letters. Covered in hearts and elegant writings, it was a love letter. I didn’t like love letters. They never showed up alone at the meeting place.

The letter read like a typical love letter, asking about the weather, his feelings and her feelings. There was even a little poem about her beautiful hair. Although the hair color didn’t match Alice’s. Actually, the letter wasn’t even addressed to her, it was to someone named Marianne. 

Should I just kill her again right here and now? My heart felt like exploding the longer I stayed here. Planning a murder wasn’t hard. One, decide on the muder weapons. Two, find a secluded space. And finally, three, try not to let the Goddess interfere at the delicate moment. 

But how would I go about killing her? The goddess wouldn't let me kill her. She wouldn’t let me kill anything for that matter. A fly buzzed around my room a few days ago. Smacking it had no effect as I saw the thing fly away. It was now laying dead in the box I trapped it in.

But how would I go about killing her? I couldn’t kill anything for that matter. A fly had buzzed around my room a few days ago, smacking the thing had no effect as it simply flew away. Opening the box I trapped it in, it was laying there dead.

Her snoring didn’t even stop as I wrapped my hands around her neck. They were too small, not even reaching halfway across the neck. It was a futile attempt anyway, my left hand was in no shape to suffocate someone to death. I had to plan this out carefully. Taking back my stolen goods, I left her to sleep peacefully for today.

“Young lady, is something the matter?” A pair of maids stood in the hall busily dusting away the displayed decorations. One of them was a vase with yellow flowers. “Do you want some candy?”

“Stop giving her whatever is in your pocket…”

This maid occasionally gave me candy. Her hair was braided in a ponytail that fluttered in the air whenever she turned. It reminded me of the braided bread I had seen once. The candy was strawberry flavored today.

I gave her one of my more practiced curtsies. “Thank you.”

“Ah, how cute\!” Miss candy maid squealed.

“You’ve improved a lot haven’t you?” The other maid poking her own cheek had a mole above where her finger was. It suited her.

“My lady, can you do this with your hands?” Her hands were sticking out from the top of her head. “Now tilt your head a little and say—”

“Meow?”

“Ah, my heart\!” Candy maid fell to her knees in the middle of the hall. She looked genuinely hurt as she clutched her chest.

“Pfft\! Ahaha\! Stop teaching her to do silly things\! Bwahaha\!” Her mole shook as she laughed.

I didn’t know what was so funny to them, still this had become a routine of sorts every time I met them. Hearing their laughter echo across the hall did make me feel a bit more upbeat.

“Do you want to play with us today? We still have some work left to do…”

“It’s okay, I don’t want to play today.” They both gaped.

“Huh? Why not? Did something happen?” The candy maid shook her fist. “Who was it? I ought to really give them a talking to.”

“Ha… And what are you going to say to them? Even the miss over here looks scarier than you.”

“Oh, my little lady, how my heart aches for you\!”

“You’re being a bit dramatic”, I said.

“Pfft\!”

“Melissa\! Don’t laugh\! This is a super serious matter, she won’t play with us\!”

“I’m on a mission today.”

“A mission you say? That sounds very serious”, said Melissa.

I nodded.

“Well, good luck on your mission, and let us know if some scoundrel shows up okay?”

“We’ll beat them black and blue for you\!” I returned their wave with my own as I continued on my mission. 

The kitchen was always busy with several people flying around. There were many employees that worked and lived in the estate, and ensuring enough food for them was tiring work. A delicious smell wafting in the air made my mouth water a little.

“My, if it isn’t little, miss Esther. Apologies, but I already promised Lady Victoria to not give you any more snacks between meals.” He closed one of his eyes. “Here take this.” The chef handed me a cookie, it tasted buttery.

“What are you making today?”

“Hmm, we got our hands on some prime cuts of deer today. Pair that up with some wine reduced demi-glace and garlic infused mushrooms and there you have it. How does that sound?”

“Sounds amazing.”

“Haha\! Amazing indeed\! You always have the best compliments.”

“Then, can you make my plate have fewer mushrooms this time too?”

“Miss Esther, you shouldn’t be too picky with your food, you know? Even my daughter is taller than you.” He indicated with his hand her height. It was half a head above my own.

“I can’t get taller by eating mushrooms.”

“On the contrary, I heard someone say mushrooms make you taller.” He smiled with a big golden circle on his mouth."

“Please?”

“That won’t work on me, miss.” He crossed his burly arms.

Fine, let me try that move. Hands above my head alluding to ears of some kind, tilt my head twenty degrees to the left, and finally. “Please?”

He stared sideways at me.

“Ha… But this is the last time okay?”

“Thank you my good sir.” I gave him my curtsy, making him give a hum of approval.

“Speaking of, have you seen my locket?” His neck was bare today.

“Did you lose it?”

“It appears so… Keep an eye out for it okay? I will do whatever I can if you can find it.”

“It appears so, keep an eye out for it okay? I will never serve you mushrooms ever again if you find it.” He winked. That should be easy enough if my plan works out. I had intended to take Alice’s whole box of stolen goods, but just like killing, I couldn’t move it. I wonder if I can drink alcohol if this pattern continues.

Standing in the forest-like garden, I stared at the gardener snipping off flowers. The large scissors made quick work as he cut them across their body, letting their heads fall pathetically to the dirty ground.

“Well if it isn’t Esther, what brings you here to this old man today?” He went down the ladder upon spotting me.

“Hello, Sir Gardener. Do you know of any secluded spots in the garden?”

“Secluded you say? Are you playing hide and seek outside this time? That’s good, someone young like you should take in the fresh air instead of staying cooped up all the time. I remember when— oh, my apologies. Let's see… there is the area behind the annex, the shed, oh. Maybe the abandoned church would be a good hiding place?”

“Abandoned church?”

“Shocking isn't it? The previous Duke was such a devoted man that he constructed a small church behind the annex where us staff live, or so they say. Don’t tell anyone about this, okay?” He whispered his next words. “But the former Duke told me that the weekly trip to the main church in the duchy had taken too much of his time. ‘I need to visit the church every Sunday? Heavens, I don’t even have time to read through the daily reports\!’ He then went on to order his men to construct a church in his back yard. Hah\! What a remarkable man.”

My mind went blank while listening to him regale his story.

“It’s over there if you want to check it out, be careful not to trip on the roots okay?”

Hopping to where he had pointed, I found a thick forest. The leaves were plentiful enough to completely block out the sun, making the inside dim and uninviting. Shouldn’t there be a path if there was a building in here? The former Duke must have been too busy to consider that point in his plan. 

Feeling the sweat trickle down my back, I considered whether or not he had played a joke on me. Right, those kinds of jokes wouldn’t work on me anymore. Leaning against a tree to catch my breath, I finally saw it. Sitting there smack dab in the middle of a sea of trees was a gray building. Nature had taken over it as countless vines spread itself on its walls, wrapping in between its many holes. A green carpet of moss and grass welcomed me into this broken down church.

I had half expectantly pictured the goddess statue to be in the same state of disarray. As if to shove it in my face, she stood there, in her always indifferent pose, looking down at me. It was infuriating. A hole in the ceiling made the sunlight stream in, lighting up the broken brick particles around the Goddess. Stop acting all important, the hole was just a coincidence.

The statue stood at the top of the altar, where vines had wrapped itself all over her feet and legs. Small cracks could be seen in her lower body but they all stopped once they reached her waist. Even as nature had done its damage, her face was untouched. Not a single crack nor a single vine covered her idiotic face. She just stood there, smiling like an idiot. Don’t think you can stop me this time.

Sitting on one of the few usable benches, all I could hear was the soft rustling of nature. Leaves shook as the wind caught them, small birds chirped their songs, and a grassy smell filled the air. 

This place would be perfect for a midday nap, if that thing didn’t stand over there. Closing my eyes didn’t help as I could still feel my skin prickle from her eyes. Maybe I should push her over.

“There you are, my sweet daughter.” My mom sat down beside me. “Did I wake you up?” The sun had shifted its position a bit. I shook my head instead of answering.

“Does the statue of the Goddess still make you feel uneasy?”

“How did you know?”

“You’re my daughter are you not? As your mother, I know everything that concerns you.” She stared at the statue. “But you know Esther, If there is someone to blame, then it would be me.”

“What do you mean?”

“If only I had been more careful that day, then those things wouldn’t happen to you…”

“It’s not your fault, mom.”

“If not mine, then whose? Who can I blame if not myself?” My mom slumped her shoulders. “I’m sorry Esther… those things shouldn’t have happened to you…” She cupped her face.

“Mom.”

“And now we have to stay here for who knows how long…”

I shook my slumped over mother. “Mom, I’m fine.” Her face scrunched up, drawing lines between her nose and eyebrows. 

“I’m having fun here at the estate. The food is good and the bed feels like sleeping on a cloud.” I listed all the interesting and fun things that I had experienced. The maids that would play with me, the chef that let me test his new recipes and the gardener that always made sure the garden was in top condition. I told her everything until my breath had run haggard.

“I see…” Good, she didn’t start crying. Her warm arms wrapped around me as her cheek nuzzled against the top of my head. “My daughter did all those things… I didn’t even notice.” Her voice rumbled through my hair.

We stayed at the abandoned church for a little while longer before a servant called us to dinner. Sorry mom, but there was one thing I didn’t mention. One thing that I had to do now.

# Chapter 18: Execution

Alice thought that this was too easy. Already in a week, she had pilfered countless items\! Jewelry, rings, necklaces, she even managed to sneak out an emerald from the Duchess herself\! Why didn’t she think of this sooner? A few more things from this rich noble house and no more would she have to play house with some girl from the countryside. 

That same girl was now standing in front of her staring at her. What an eerie child, she thought. It was a wonder how all of the other maids found her cute. Not a day would go before this girl or that girl would say something like, ‘she’s so pretty\!’ or ‘I wish my daughter was as lovely as her.’ Just look at her eyes\! They look like the taxidermied animals\!

Oh, and she didn’t even mention that left hand of hers. It was disgusting. All those hypocritical people gushing over her would surely turn their opinion around had they seen it. Bathing a child was already an ordeal of itself, now add a puke-inducing sight on top of that. 

Luckily, the child appeared to know that her hand disgusted people as she always hid it with that glove of hers. Only letting it show above the bathwater to wash her armpits. 

Why, she had been shocked beyond reason the first time she saw it. Expecting a small burn or a scratch, a whole beast of flesh greeted her. She had served a nobleman a piece of meatloaf once. Instead of calling her to take it back like a normal person, he would rather slam into it with his fist instead. He was promptly escorted out by the servants. The poor piece of meatloaf had been a lasting memory, her hand looked just like that.

“Alice.” Just hearing that child call her name sent shivers down her spine.

“What is it my lady?”

“I have a letter for you.” She was thankfully right handed.

“A letter for me?” Sure enough, a letter was in her hand. Who was it from? 

“I will be busy for a bit, you’re dismissed.” Sure, what would a fourteen year old girl be busy with.

Reading the letter, Alice had to muffle her squeal upon reaching the middle part. This couldn’t be. It was a love letter\! Oh my days, she knew it was a fluke when that girl, Melissa, had gotten one before her. Believe in yourself and so shall the goddess believe in you. All her praying had finally paid off\!

Your hair is beautiful like the countless rivers streaming down the duchy, that’s right. All I see at night is your sleeping silhouette in my bed. Oh, my, gosh. Who was this daring fellow\! There on the bottom a neat signature was adorned with hearts. Signed Ronald. 

A puff of air rose atop of her head. He was one of the more handsome ones of the knights\! She had shirked away from her tasks once to look at them train, the sight was still fresh in her memory as she wiped away the drool that had escaped her mouth. Ronald was the one with the green hair right? Not bad, she nodded. Not bad at all.

‘Under the sweet moonlight, I want to bare my feelings to you. Will you chance me a meeting at the abandoned church, my lovely Alice.’ There was a heart beside her name. It was too much for a pure maiden like her. She had to give him a piece of her mind. At night that is. Perhaps in a warm bed. With newfound gusto, Alice went quickly to work to gather information about this so-called abandoned church.

She asked a maid with braided hair. It really looked like braided bread.

“A church? Why would there be a church here? But I’m not that familiar with the lay of the land. Maybe one of the older ones knows? Should I ask for you?”

She asked the cook.

“We’re a little bit busy in here\! A kitchen is like a battlefield–”

She asked the elderly gardener.

The gardener rambled on and on the importance of having trusted people in one’s life. The sun had already begun to sink in the sky when he finally told her the location. In here?

Pitch black darkness flooded the overgrown forest. A rat-like squirrel flitted across the countless trees. Alice did not want to go in there, not in her maid uniform at least. She went and changed into her most elegant dress. 

Holding a lamp in one hand, and the hem of her dress in the other, she ventured into the forest. Spotting the gray building hidden in the sea of trees, she thought it was ugly. Priests had always liked to drone on and on about the importance of the five commandments and all that, but it wasn’t until she broke them that good fortune had shone on her. 

Taking a seat on one of the few sturdy benches, she waited. Would he really come? What would he think about her dress? She had bought it after the run in with the Duchess. She didn’t die and I got to wear something pretty, all’s well that ends well, right? She thought to herself, sitting in the gloomy ruined church.

Where was he? The moonlight was shining as he had written and it was getting a bit cold. Persevere, Alice\! Love doesn’t come for the weak ones\! Repeating that mantra helped her feel a little warmer. 

Three children would be the ideal amount. Two boys and one girl. Imagining their stubby legs running up to her filled her heart, and then her husband would wrap his arm around the waist, and pull her into a kiss. Oh my gosh. Alice let her mind run wild as she waited for Ronald. A full moon peeked from the roof making the statue shine. Something was sitting in the palm of its hand.

Approaching the altar, she glanced at the thing. It was a pouch. Not just any pouch, it was that girl’s pouch she had stolen. What was it doing here? 

The statue was double her size, making her have to stand on her toes to even reach the goddess’ waist. A little more, it was so close. What if she were to only use one of her legs? 

Stretching towards the pouch surely filled with coins, Alice’s body wobbled as she tried to both balance herself on the tips of her toes and reach for the treasure. The feeling of fabric on her fingertip filled her with much excitement as she stretched even further. It looked like a sinner stretching for the heavens. Then she felt it.

Her eyes followed the pouch as it got further and further away. She was falling. Something had swept away her leg. Was this what the Duchess felt as she was pushed down the stairs? 

“Gah\!” All the air in her lungs got knocked out as she barreled towards the cold floor. Before even having the chance to process the situation, something rough wrapped around her neck as something pushed down on her shoulders.

Alice’s eyes darted around trying to find who it was choking her. The stretching of her neck made it only possible to look down and upwards. Moonlight made the golden strands of hair look even more blinding than normal. Damn it\! It was that girl\!

Like a worm being burnt by the sun, she wriggled on the ground not caring in the least about her new dress. She had to escape somehow. Clawing at the rope on her neck didn’t seem to work, only making her nails cut into it, drawing fresh blood and leaving red marks. She was going to pass out soon unless she did something. 

How could that small girl have such a strong grip\! Her vision began to darken as the overwhelming pressure on her shoulders increased. A disgusting cracking sound reverberated through the church, under the goddess’ eyes as her trachea got crushed from the winch on her neck. Alice passed out.

Did she finally pass out? The golden circle appeared before my eyes as I saw her hands stop clawing at the rope. Haa… my body would surely ache tomorrow. I had successfully done the first half of the plan, the hard part was coming now. How could I kill her?

Did she die? The golden circle did appear when a satisfying crunch rang out. Ha… my body would surely ache tomorrow. Like two dead fish, I laid on top of her while checking her pulse. She was still alive. That would have been too easy, no? Wouldn’t you agree, goddess. You just stand there and look pretty.

I wasn’t someone insane enough to experiment on human bodies, but this had to be done. Taking out a knife one of the chefs gave me, I saw my own face reflected on it. What an ordeal it was to find a justified reason for them to give me one. A drop of water blurred my face. The clouds overhead were starting to cry.

I stabbed into the unconscious body before me. The golden circle blared like a warning signal as the raindrops multiplied in numbers. You think some rain can stop this? You better come down personally if you want to save one of your own. 

In conclusion, stabbing didn’t work no matter how I did it. That’s to be expected. I pinched her nose and shut her mouth next. My gloves had gotten wrinkled from all that action earlier. Especially my left glove. Exerting force with my left hand was useless, so I opted to wrap the rope around the wrist instead. Like a chain, pulling my elbow back also pulled the rope tied to my useless hand. I would have to use my old pair when I got back.

Her chest rose as her unconscious body did its best to get some oxygen in its lungs. Up and down, up and down. It was getting faster and faster. The rain had soaked my hair at this point, running down my face and onto hers. A golden circle jammed itself between my fingers making her gasp like a fish out of water. So that’s how that works. I should just hang her then. A thunderous roar lit up the sky as my body was being pelleted by the rain.

I found out by accident once that a hangman’s noose was surprisingly easy to tie. Make an s-shape and wrap the other end a few times around it before pulling the tail through one of the loops. That was the easy part of the plan, now I just needed something heavy enough to lift her in the air and an anchor that was reachable even for me. 

The rain hit my face as I surveyed the tall ceiling. My body heat was starting to disappear, the rain was surprisingly effective at stealing it. Maybe I underestimated her powers a little bit. Wait. The glorified chunk of rock appeared to be crying with the streams of rain rolling down her stupid face. Not smiling anymore are we? I just got an interesting idea.

Flinging the noose around the goddess’ outstretched hand, I looped it around Alice’s neck. That back door seemed to be heavy enough.

# Chapter 19: Storm

Amazing. It all worked out perfectly. The door hinges on the giant door had rotted away, making it even possible for someone like me to make it fall. Alice’s body hung gracefully in the air as the door stood at an angle.

The fallen door had jerked her body up at first, making her dangle like a pendulum in the rain. My body shook each time a nearby lighting crashed. They were like fireworks. It mesmerized me. Golden circles popped around Alice’s neck. 

“You idiot\! You are just making it worse\! Haha\!”

A laugh slipped out of me when I saw that the eternally glowing circles dug into her neck. 

“How does it feel\! You’re the one killing her, not me\! I won\! You lost and I won\!” 

One by one, the circles disappeared. What sweet satisfaction, what sweet victory. I found a way to kill them\! 

“Ha ha. Ha ha\! Ha ha ha\!” The solemn thunder painting the background of my victory filled me with unimaginable glee. If only I could take a picture of that pathetic expression, my goddess.

\*\*\*  
“Honey, wake up”

“Hmm?” 

Gale’s body shook as something rustled him. This felt familiar. Even the deer with the magnificent antlers felt familiar.

“Gale get up\!”

“I’m up, I’m up\!” Victoria’s hand was raised in the air. A second later and that would have been plastered on his face. “What is it? Is this about Esther?” 

Gale thought his wife’s anxiety had gotten better lately, her nightly trips to their daughter's room had abated a bit after all. Like clockwork, she would leave the bed to go check up on her in the middle of the night. He had tried to convince her to sleep upon noticing her increasingly deeper eye bags, but the result was detrimental to them both. She would just toss and turn without getting a wink of sleep.

“I can’t find her\!” 

“What do you mean?” Shouldn’t she be sleeping? Children like her had to sleep to grow.

“Gale\! This can’t be happening again\!” A bolt of lightning lit up their room. Victoria looked haggard. 

Damn it\! Why did his daughter always disappear in the middle of night\! The incessant clacking of the rain against the window, filled his head, making the already chaotic situation worse. 

Flinging open the door to his daughter’s room filled him with nothing besides dread. She really was gone. Who the hell did it this time\!

“Victoria, ring the alarm\! I’m going to ask my father for help\!”

What benefit did such a large estate have? It only made the distance to his father's room even farther than it should be. The carpet crumpled under each of his steps as he sprinted in the hall. 

Gale was about to force open the door when it unexpectedly opened by itself. The Duke was still awake.

“What is this ruckus you are making in the dead of the night?” It was hard to sleep with all the lightning crashing around his domain. What a terrible night, he thought.

“Father, I need you to mobilize the knights\!” Garius had planned to shoo away his son after opening the door. He had often asked him for something in the younger days, however the way his face looked right now was unlike those times. No anger, no sulking. Only concern and determination filled the once boyish face, he was a proper man now. And who was he to reject a request from such a man?

“Tell me about the situation on the way, there better not be another war breaking out.” Garius marched toward the barracks, where the knights and his trusted commander were currently holding watch.

“Huh? Why would– Esther is missing\!” 

“What do you mean?” Why would his granddaughter be missing at this time of the night? There was even a storm brewing outside. “Did this happen last time too?” He thought about the girl’s hand. A silent rage boiled inside him. He didn’t need to hear his son’s reply to guess the situation.

“We better run then.”

All the knights in the ducal house were mobilized. An enormous search party was combing through all the nooks and crannies of the property. Even with their soaked clothes, not a single one complained as they knew the reason why their sleep had been cut short. Perhaps to make up for the failure of protecting the Duchess, the knights moved faster than usual. In the middle of the roaring storm, a blanket of lamps spread itself not letting a single piece of darkness remain.

“Why don’t you use your magic to find her?” The Duke looked at the map of the surrounding area. “Search the hill next\!” The commander repeated his command, bellowing loud enough to cut through the harsh rain.

“There’s too much noise.” Gale grit his teeth. Why was his magic so useless when it mattered the most? It was impossible to discern whose trail he was seeing.

“Gale, I think I know where she may be\!” His wife was soaked from head to toe, her hair flew helplessly in the wind. She didn’t even change out of her night gown, only holding on to the coat he had given her. “Please search the church\!”

His instincts kicked in. Call it a gut feeling or whatever, but he knew his wife was right.

“Father\! Order the men to surround the church\! I’m going ahead\!” Grabbing his sword, Gale ran toward the forest.

The church in there had been one of his childhood spots. He would always find himself sitting in there whenever something had bothered him that day. Whether it was his father or his siblings, it didn’t matter. The church was magical, always managing to calm him down. 

Everything was opposite today, anxiety welled in his heart as he traced the familiar path toward the church. His father had even followed his orders, not even grumbling once. The rain whipped his face as he picked up the pace. Two faint trails were beginning to show themselves, one of them was gray, the color of his daughter.

With the lightning hitting dangerously close to where he was, he spotted something golden glimmering between the trees. It was his daughter.

“Esther\!” He found her.

“Oh, daddy\!” She was smiling brightly at him. In clothes that were a smidge better than his wife’s, all soaked to her bones, his daughter was standing in between the trees smiling at him. Her crescent moons could be seen clearly each time a new roar filled the sky.

\*\*\*  
Karrie would always say that my mom was several times better than her own. I agreed each time because it was simply true. Victoria was prettier with her unblemished fair skin and silky smooth hair like golden strands. She wasn’t too thin nor too thick, and she had a gentle voice and face. This didn’t mean that Karrie’s mom was some hideous person or something, she was just, you know, average.

However, standing here with my hands behind my back, I bit my lips. Gone was her gentle voice, gone was her gentle smile, and gone was the gentle mother who would always give me a hug. Victoria was standing there with her hair falling down her face, a face which I never wanted to see her wear. I averted my gaze back towards my shoes. They were dirty. Flecks of dirt could be seen sticking on them.

“Esther\!” My shoulders jumped.

“What were you thinking\! How could you think to run out in this weather\! You could have gotten seriously hurt\!” 

Her voice rang in my ears. “Mom…”

“I don’t want to hear it\! You had no reason to be outside at this time\! Do you know how scared I felt when you weren’t in your room again\!?”

I felt my throat seize up.

“What were you thinking\!”

My body felt like it was burning. Everything itched.

“Is it your intention to always worry me?\!” I didn’t like this. She was scary.

“You are going to ruin me\!”

“M-mom I didn’t—”

“How am I going to pay the bills now?\! All you had to do was pour him a damn drink, it’s not that hard is it?

“But he was making me uncomfortable…”

“So what\! You don’t think I feel uncomfortable every working day?\! I had to even pay off my own boss\!” She was grabbing at her hair. She had used a lot of time to curl them this morning. Now it was all messed up. I had messed up.

“AHHH\!” Her yell shook me to my core. She grabbed her half empty bottle and slammed it against the kitchen wall. The remaining liquid dripped down, making the already dirty walls even dirtier. 

“How could you not even entertain one single guest\! You’re such a failure\!”

“M-mom please calm d-down.”

“How the hell am I supposed to calm down\! You think it was easy getting that job, huh? Do you have any idea of the things I had to do?\!”

“Mom… I’m sorry…” I crawled to her legs.

“Let go of me\! You and your father\! You must think life comes easy, don’t you\! Disgusting parasites\!”

“I w-will do better next time\!” I had to help my mother. She was always working so hard. That’s right, that’s all I needed to—

Smack\! “There is no damn next time\!” My head hit the messy floor. Why was it always so messy? “It’s gone, the whole job is gone\!” I could get a part time job, I could go recycle the heaps of thrash. I just needed to get some money–

“Get the hell out of my house\!” 

“Mom, please don’t throw me out\!” My body got dragged as she yanked my hair towards the front door.

“I should have never had you\!” 

She didn’t mean that. I just had to wait a little. I just had to wait until she opened the door again.

“Mom, let me in please\! Please open the door\!” Whether my hands were red from the cold night air or me banging on our locked door, I didn’t know. I just knew that my mother would let me in soon.

“It’s all ruined\! Damn it\!”

“I swear to do better\! Please\!” She would let me in soon.

“Mom… don’t abandon me…” She had to.

“Oh dear, what’s wrong?” There she was.

“Heh, you’re back…”

“Of course, I’m always here for you.”

Her warm arms wrapped around me. She would always do this after calming down. 

“I didn’t mean to worry you…”

“I know you did, I’m sorry for yelling at you.”

“It’s my fault… it’s all my fault mom…”

“Don’t say that, you’re my daughter.”

“Please, hic\! Don’t abandon me again.”

“Huh?”

“I’m sorry mom, I will do anything, please give me another chance\!” Why couldn’t I just pour them a drink. Their poisonous eyes meant nothing. 

“Sweetie, what are you saying?” Fill their cup with that disgusting liquid.

“I will help us get money\! I will help you at work\! Hic\! I will get a part time job somewhere\!” I tried to smile. I needed to.

“Esther, what are you saying?”

“You won’t have to worry about me anymore\! Just don’t throw me out\!”

“Gale, something is wrong with her\!”

“Mom, please don't throw me out again…”

“Esther\!” Something shook my body. “Someone go fetch the physician\!”

“It’s scary outside…”

# Chapter 20: Aftermath

“Have you ever seen a ghost before?” TK

“I don’t believe in ghosts.”

“Why not?” The monk had brewed some pu-erh tea, it looked brown and smelled like fish. I’d rather have that bitter green tea over this. “We all have four ghosts hovering above us, you know?”

“What? You have killed four people?”

“Ha ha\! I didn’t mean it like that.” His round belly shook from the laughter. 

“Each person has four ghosts attached to them. One, the ghost of attachment. This one affects our wants. Two, the ghost of idk. Three, the ghost of idk. And four, the ghost of idk.”

“How about it, makes sense right?”

“Not really.” I thought of my mom, what ghost had taken over her that day?

“Then what about real ghosts?”

“Those exist too of course”, he smiled. “Why do you think food is always offered on the altar?”  
\*\*\*

Victoria and Gale watched their daughter collapse from her own wailing. They had initially intended to only ask her why she was gone from her room that night, but emotions were hard to predict and Victoria’s had reached its peak. How could she maintain her cool when her daughter came back soaked in rain and dirt? What was she even doing there?

However none of that concerned them. Esther had babbled something nonsensical between her sobs. Sobs which had come out of nowhere. Victoria had just started her tirade when their daughter’s body suddenly trembled and fell to her knees. She said she was sorry, but why? Esther had always been the apple of their eye. Nothing she did would need her to be sorry about. Except for this one time.

Holding his limp daughter in his arms, Gale thought she weighed too little. Add onto her past history of illnesses, and they couldn’t help but love their pitiful daughter. She had never complained, not even a grumble and always did what was asked of her. It continued even after she lost her memories.

A part of her nature, they thought. However, seeing the terrified face when Victoria scolded her, they knew something was wrong. Oh Goddess. Whatever did our daughter do to deserve this? She recalled that time when Esther had screamed and cried in front of the Goddess. It was the first time she saw Esther behave like that. It wasn’t normal.

Victoria stroked her sleeping daughter’s hair. Small bits of twigs and leaves were stuck in it. A seed of guilt grew in her as she plucked all the pieces. There had been no need to scold her. She was old enough to know what she had done wrong herself. But Victoria had to, just this once. And the result was this.

She felt her shoulders warm up as Gale draped a blanket around her. 

“What do you think she meant?” She grasped her husband's hand.

“I’m not sure, but she didn’t look to be in the right state of mind.”

“What happened in Barre and now this… I can’t help but worry, Gale.”

“I know.”

“She’s still just a girl. So much has already happened to her.”

“We just have to do what we always do.”

“What if she loses her memory again? She had just begun to look happier… What did the physician say again? A sickness of the mind?”

“Let’s not think about it anymore. We just need to care for her like always. It’s just a simple fever.”

“You’re right…” Their daughter was sweating profusely in her sleep.

Gale stood vigil, watching over his wife and daughter. They had both fallen asleep. He thought himself lucky to have such a beautiful family, yet it seemed like the world had turned against them. 

He had furrowed his eyebrows when Esther told him that she didn’t like the statues of the Goddess. Thankfully she said it in their home. It was a blaspheme comment coming from his own daughter, however he couldn’t help but agree inwards. If the Goddess was as benevolent as they preached, why didn’t she show their daughter a single ounce of it? 

Gale thought of the times when they visited the church together. Esther, without fail, would always frown whenever she stepped into the building, and on rare occasions, he could see her glaring at the statue while grinding her teeth. It was a total opposite of her expression that night.

He had never seen such a bright smile from his daughter, she even called him daddy, something she hadn’t done for a long time. He didn’t want to admit it but it was eerie. It bothered him. Not a single child would be smiling in that situation. Especially when he investigated the church where another mana trail was leading him. Perhaps the physician was right.

\*\*\*  
My body ached. Don’t tell me I died again. A nailing pain shot up from my left hand.   
The sight reminded me of the beach I had seen once. Feeling the sand beneath my toes, I listened to the ocean waves crashing into the rocky banks. Each time the tide ebbed and flowed, small rolling dunes were made in the sand. Like the body of a worm, the surface zig-zagged under my feet, it felt disgusting. Giving the sea a long stare, I put my shoes back on. I didn’t want to swim in that cold water anymore.

Sitting on a chair like always, mom’s sleeping visage greeted me. The sun was brightening the room and her hair, but it was still chilly. Goosebumps had popped up on my arms where the blanket didn’t reach. I had done it again, I made her sleep like that again. What even happened yesterday? My head throbbed whenever I thought about it.

A cool feeling grazed the bottom of my toes as I slid them off the bed. It tickled. Wooden grains caressed my feet while I took a moment to prepare myself to stand. Something let out a soft thump as my butt felt those very same wooden grains

“Huh?” I had collapsed.

“Hmm…” Stirring to life, my mom stretched her arms towards the ceiling. I flinched for some reason. 

“Oh\! What are you doing on the floor?” Her blanket flew off as she raced toward me. 

“Mom, did you get stronger?” She had lifted my whole body back on the bed. I sat on the edge and looked at her.

“Your mother is always strong, you know?” Her smile was gentle as always.

“Where’s father?”

“Do you want me to go fetch him?”

“No, it's okay… What happened yesterday?”

She cocked her head. “Yesterday? Nothing worth mentioning happened yesterday.” What did she mean? A whooshing sound rang in my ears as the heart accelerated, pumping its warm blood throughout my cold body.

“Where’s Alice?” 

“Oh, are you still sleepy? She took a vacation last week.” 

Last week? That’s impossible. I killed her yesterday. She should be dead. Dead people don’t take vacations do they? The timeline didn’t even match up. Maybe she would still be hanging–

“Good morning miss\! How are you feeling today?” The braided hair maid caught sight of me in the hallway.

“I feel fine…”

“A person that says they feel fine never feels fine. Want some candy?”

“I really feel fine.” Besides the aches and the occasional wobbling legs, I truly felt fine. There were more important things to think about. A sour taste filled my mouth, it was lemon candy today.

“Miss, you don’t need to listen to her nonsense.” The maid with the beauty mark leant in closer. “By the way, she hates lemon candy.” 

“Ah, Melisssa\! How could you spill my secrets in front of our adorable miss\!”

She shrugged. “Just telling the truth is all.”

“Have you two seen Alice?” 

“Don’t even get me started.” I turned my ears towards the bubbly maid. “How could she ask for a vacation at this time of the year, not only that, sir Alden agreed\! Oh, the injustice us plain maids feel in our daily life.”

“Quiet your laments, girl. These vases won’t dust themselves off.”

A week. Seven days. Did I sleep for that long? No, she asked how I was today. She wouldn’t say that if I was gone for a week. My goddess, what did you do now? I hurried my steps on the rough carpet.

“Oh, you look more energetic today, little miss. Had us worried there for a second\!” The cook laughed with gusto. “Look here, I finally found it again.” He pulled out the locket he would always wear. “It was in my drawer this whole time, can you believe it?” No, I could not. Alice had stolen that very same locket.

“Alice? My apologies but I haven’t seen her since that storm hit us. Why, my ears are still ringing from all the lightning. Someone must have really upset the goddess for her to send so many of them.”

The garden was spotless. Not a single leaf littered the grass. Not a single footprint could be seen. A vivid image of several knights running around in the rain filled my head. Was that all a dream? I don’t think trampled grass grew back this quick.

I spotted the gardener pruning the bushes as if my thoughts didn’t matter. “I knew young people these days were different, but how could she ask for a vacation after that mess of a storm?” The storm did happen. “Her destination? I’m afraid I don’t know such details. Do you want me to ask sir Alden? We have been friends for decades. It all started when–”

Everyone was saying the same thing. Alice had taken a vacation last week. The storm happened last week too, yet they all acted as if I had been walking around for the last few days. Why can’t I remember? Why? I stepped on the wildflowers growing between the tree roots.

The abandoned church still looked abandoned. Not a single thing was different about the gray building. Vines were still consuming the crumbling brick wall. Holes stood in the same places as before. And the statue was still standing there in the middle of it all.

It was gone. Where her body should be hanging, it was gone. Did I really kill her? Had she somehow survived? My knees collapsed to the cold mossy carpet.

“Did you do this?” I glared at the statue. She wasn’t smiling this time.

“What are you looking sad for? I should be the one being sad\! The nerve you have to not only mess with my plans again but also my head?\! Who are you to do that\!”

“Where is she? Where did you hide her\!” A drop of morning dew stained the woman’s cheek.

“Are you crying right now? Who gave you permission to do that\! You have the gall to cry in front of me?”

“Don’t say that. I am not insane. Where is Alice? She is dead\!”

“Stop getting in my way\!”

A voice called out my name in the wind. Impressive. The rock actually replied.

“Esther, you shouldn’t be here.” I whipped my head around.

“Father?” Did he hear me? “What are you doing here?”

“That’s what I should be asking you.” His eyes were devoid of the usual warmth. Ah, I should run away.

“I can’t believe you returned back here even after what happened.”

My legs wouldn’t move. His aura was oppressive.

“I know what you tried to do, I even lied to your mother.” I was reminded of the play Eric and Karrie had taken me to that one time. Especially the ending. Just like that pitiful woman, would I too have my head cut off? I wonder which hurt more, that or being shot again.

“I don’t know what you mean?”

“You don’t need to hide it from me.” He took a step closer. “Esther”, he grabbed my shoulder, this was the end. “It’s not your fault, no one can stop a person willing to forsake their own life. You must have felt devastated.”

What?

His face was full of concern, the corners of his eyes shrunk into themselves as he pulled me into an embrace. I could hear his heart pump under his clothes.

“It must have been horrible seeing someone take their own life like that.”

The air felt refreshing as it blew gently on my bangs. Peeking over my father’s shoulder I saw the goddess looking down at us. So that was the reason she was crying. I had won. 

“Are you cold?” My body trembled as I tried to conceal the rising laughter. Thank goddess that he couldn’t see my face at this moment.

# Chapter 21: Cafe

The following week after I woke up was surprisingly ordinary. I woke up, ate tasty food, the desserts were the best, and played with the maids whenever I wasn’t too tired. Speaking of, Melissa had become my new personal maid. 

Candy maid grumbled up a storm when the news broke, speaking out about the injustice in the world and all that. Honestly, I was glad sir Alden picked Melissa instead of her. She was, in a good way, too energetic for me. I liked her candies though. 

“Which gloves do you want to wear today, miss?” Melissa held up two pairs for me to decide. The left one was made of a white thin fabric that went up half my arm length. The paintings often depicted women wearing this kind. The other was in a darker shade, the brown color bordered on the side of black. This one looked less cumbersome, only covering up to where the bone on the wrist stuck out.

“You look really cool wearing that.” 

“Cool?” I gave my fingers a few bends. “But I want to be pretty.”

“Of course, you’re both cool and pretty.”

“Hmm.” Was that possible? I stared at myself in the mirror. Melissa was braiding my long golden hair. I wonder what hairstyle this one was called. She tied a purple ribbon to it, making it flutter each time I turned my head. 

“It’s good seeing you enjoy yourself, miss.” My heart felt really light lately. “But be careful not to make yourself dizzy.”

Sitting in the carriage, I got dizzy. The thought of doing something else besides roaming around the ducal house made me forget how my body would react. Rustling each time the horse stopped or sped up, my body on the seats. A little groan slipped out of me. “Ugh…”

“What a sorry sight, you should eat more.”

“She already eats enough as it is.”

My father and grandfather were like two peas in a pod, looking exactly the same as they crossed their arms at each other. We were having a family trip to the capital today. First stop, the grand church. My mom rubbed my back as the building came into view.

Like fish swimming in a river, all sorts of people streamed through the grand front doors looking for a spot to settle in to. It was impressive how deeply rooted religion meant in place. In all my time sheltering at the temple, not a single guest had popped up besides myself. 

I didn’t mind too much as it was enough talking to the monks, however they would sometimes say a comment or two about how people had forgotten about religion in modern times. It was by pure chance that I myself had visited them, I never had the time nor energy to remember something lofty as religion. 

The church in Barre did not even compare to this one in the capital. That one was tall enough to make me crane my neck at its pointed roofs, but this one, as if challenging the authority of the goddess, was tall enough to pierce the heavens. I couldn’t even see the top of it.

Using another path from the main one, a priest greeted us.

“Welcome your Grace, I see that you are not alone today?” He gave each of us a look.

“Yes, my wife is still in her coma.”

“O-oh…” 

Like father like son, the two men passed by the flubbing priest without even giving him a glance. 

“Shall we find a seat too?” Holding my mom’s hand, the two of us nodded to the priest before entering the church proper. We found ourselves in the upper seats right behind the other nobles. 

How did I know they were nobles? It was obvious. Only those kinds of people would wear something so eye-catching at a place like the church. We wore simple colors today, mine was a light blue dress, my mom’s was a pastel turquoise. The men in our group both wore black suits. 

Waving their hand-fans to their mouth, chatter and giggles began coming from the ladies in front of me. A vibrant red dress adorned with diamonds that glittered in the light. The other was wearing a vivid green dress while wearing a necklace inlaid with emeralds. Her earrings looked like grapes as they hung from her elongated ears. They were wearing tall hats too, which blocked my view from seeing the statue of the goddess. It irritated me.

My mom had fussed a bit this morning when she heard the itinerary. She must have been worried that I would feel uncomfortable, however strangely enough. Ever since that day it didn’t bother me anymore. The statue could come to life and I wouldn’t even care. I had proven myself.

“Do you want to wear your hat today?” She had asked. In her hands was the very same sun hat I used last summer.

“Isn’t it rude to wear a hat inside a church?” It was a stupid question considering the sight in front of me.

The tall red hat turned to the other. “Another Sunday, another church visit. How many times has it been now?”

“More than we can count on our fingers and toes.” The shorter hat answered, making them give out a ‘ho ho’ and ‘ha ha’. 

Their forced laughter echoed for a bit as the entire church had gone quiet. The head priest had entered. He too had a hat. A tall one that made his already short stature look even shorter. Was a tall hat a sign of someone’s status in the kingdom? I thought back on the lessons I had gotten.

To prepare me for the future, the Duke announced that he would appoint a tutor for me. My parents had gaped in shock at our little tea party.   
“What do you mean by that?” My father asked.

“Have you become daft too? You are going to get a noble title soon, which means she would also become a noble. Or what? You want her to act like some country girl forever?”

“Mother hasn’t woken up yet.”

“And who knows when she will.” My grandfather looked at me. “You’re starting tomorrow.”

I had to blink a few times seeing my new tutor, It was Raviel. The same person that had given us that letter that started all of this. 

“Your curtsy is surprisingly decent enough. Did you copy from your mother?” I nodded. She said that it made sense, as my movements were too adult-like, jilted she called it. 

Before I knew it, the people around us rose from their seats. The head priest had finished his droning sermon. The fresh air outside cleansed my nostrils of the mixture of perfumes that had attacked it. 

“Want to go eat something sweet?” Mom asked me. I glanced at the dozen knights acting as our bodyguards for today. They gave off an intimidating air with their scabbards at ease. Mom didn’t seem to care about them, giving me a bright smile instead.

She said father and grandfather would take a while to go through some of their business, and it wasn’t often we had a chance to be by ourselves, exploring shops and cafes at our leisure. The two of us went on our merry way, a small army trailing discreetly behind us.

The interior of the cafe was half filled with women of all ages sitting around their circular tables. A single table housed men, those were some of the knights that had followed us. A green ponytail, short orange hair and an elderly man. I took a double take as the commander himself read through the menu.

“What do you want to choose?” Eight different desserts were written on the leaflet, reading them didn’t help much however. Ganache? Meringue? I had learnt some of the more important noble houses but none of them sounded like these.

“Can you choose for me?”

“In that case, why don’t we celebrate today\!” A server came up to our table.

“What will it be, madam?”

“From here”, she pointed at the top of the menu and dragged her finger down, “to here. We will have everything.” The server stood frozen for a bit before writing down our order.

“Will that be alright?” She looked at us. Two people couldn’t finish eight plates of desserts, must be what she thought.

“It will be more than allright, you don’t have to worry about leftovers.” Mom winked. 

The eight plates of desserts fought for room on our table. We even had some doubled up plates in those plate cages. A rainbow had set itself on our table with their wide array of colors. Cakes, cookies and pies. They all had a different color. 

Never in my life had I seen so much sugar in front of me. Desserts at the estate paled in comparison. This had to be too much, no way the two of us could eat all of this. 

Cutting into a slice of cake with my fork, the soft exterior gave way revealing the different layers inside it. Green on the outside with light brown and white layers. The white layer was some kind of cream as it melted on my tongue. It tasted like apples and definitely sweet. 

Getting a sweet tooth was not something I thought I would get. Maybe it was because it was hard to find desserts in my previous life, like a dried out sponge, I would always have enough room in my stomach for desserts and sugary dishes. Ever since moving to the ducal house, I had at least something sweet to nibble on every day.

Contrary to my belief, the two of us finished all the dishes. Even the server looked astonished as she saw the eight polished plates. Mom gently patted her mouth with a napkin as if it was a normal matter. Copying what she did, I saw several colors of cream and glaze painting a lip on the napkin.

“Goodness, maybe it had been too much. Did you enjoy yourself, sweetie?” She sparkled as if something had soothed her soul. I was about to answer when something interrupted me.

“Haa… these nouveau riche nobles are utterly lacking in class.” Someone sighed from our neighboring table. I recognized their hats. 

“What can you expect from those people that only think of money? Of course they won’t be able to think of something else.”

“You have come up with a fine point there milady.” Two loud snaps coming from their fans was followed by a high-pitched grating laughter. I saw my mom’s eye twitch a bit. 

“But to think we have to share the floor with them, this establishment doesn’t know who it should cater to.”

“Indeed.” 

Mom’s already wide smile went even wider. It looked similar to the smile Raviel tried to teach me. 

“Remember, you must never say what you truly want. Like a hunter circling its prey, you have to gradually hover around the main point until it gets exhausted. Only when it collapses, right there in the spot you want it, can you go for the kill.” What a weird metaphor… “Never show that you are a hunter first.”

“Why not? That sounds stupid.” 

“Miss, you shouldn’t use scathing words like stupid either.”

“What if I see something or someone really stupid then?” Raviel sat across from me thinking about my question. Her blue hair rustled when she found the answer.

“Then just smile at them. Like this.” 

My mom raised her voice. “Ha. To think that such rich people have the free time and energy to sit on the same floor as us. Shouldn’t they just use their overwhelming abundance of money to reserve the upper floor for themselves? Better yet, they should reserve this whole floor. Don’t you agree, my lovely daughter?” The two of them had definitely heard her comment as I gave them the side eye.

“Look at her speak, they truly only think about money.” Her voice wasn’t as cheerful as before. “There are other things in life you know?” She was talking at her cafe partner.

“Yes, things in life such as tasting each and every type of dessert this fine establishment has to offer. One wouldn’t be able to form a proper opinion by only tasting half of it would they?” She glanced at their table. “Apologies, maybe saying half the menu had been too generous.”

Slam\! The tallest hat stood up in a fury, almost making her chair fall over. “The gall\! Who are you to form an opinion of my finances\!” The employees seemed at a loss on what to do, darting their eyes here and there as the other customers began to murmur. Our bodyguards didn’t even react, opting instead to focus on their own desserts. 

Even with the huffing and puffing coming from the table next to us, Mom still didn’t turn her head at them. “Isn’t it a fact? At least I don’t wear hats that used to be popular six, seven years ago.” She sipped her cup of tea.

She stomped over to us, finally the bodyguards moved. “You\!—”

“Milady\! Calm yourself\!” Her partner held her back. 

“Let me go\! I have something to say to her\!”

“I understand, but please take the situation into consideration\!” She pleaded with the enraged woman. The soft murmurs had developed into fully blown chatter as words such as ‘nobles’ and ‘useless pride’ flew around.

Sticking out her tongue at the fleeing women, my mom sneered at their hurried backs. I had no idea what just happened.

“Sorry about that sweetie… The sugar must have done something to me. I couldn’t just let her blabber her mouth.”

“Mom, you were amazing. I think I understand what Lady Raviel meant now.” Mom was a terrific hunter.

“Ha ha, you think so?” She was glowing in the sunlight.

Leaving the cafe behind, we found ourselves resting in a nearby park. 

“The weather is so nice today…” Mom nodded off mid-sentence. Sitting with my sleeping mom was enjoyable in itself, however all the sugar in my body wanted me to move around. A group of ducks caught my attention. They were sunbathing by a pond.

The pondy smell filled my nose as I crouched by its edge. There were some frogs hopping and ribbiting about in my shadow. Poking at them with a stick didn’t seem to disturb their stoic behaviour. Was that how you used that word? Stoic, stowic. It sounded silly, much like these frogs. A new shadow merged into my own. Someone was standing behind me.

“Is that fun?” Whipping my head around, a boy stood against the sun, making his already light blonde-platinum hair even lighter. It looked translucent. Squinting my eyes, I could see his half-smile.

# Chapter 22: Halo

I kept poking the silly frogs. They gave out a squeak each time. “Yup, it’s fun.” 

“I don’t think they like getting poked at?” 

“I highly doubt that. Look, they are not even moving.” Its glassy eyes did not contain a single shred of concern as I continued to poke at it. Besides, it’s not like I could hurt them that easily anyway.

There was a time in biology class when we had to dissect a frog. Laying there on the metal tray, I could see its lungs moving up and down in its drugged out body. Squeals and laughter filled the gray laboratory as the other kids either cut into the frogs or pulled out their phones to film them. Cutting into its white belly, a line of red blood streamed out where my scalpel passed by. It reflected the cold tube lights on the ceiling.

“Wow, you’re a natural at this.” Ann was my biology partner that day. “All we need is to pull out the heart, right? Yuck, they could have at least killed them beforehand.” She pulled the stomach skin with a pair of tweezers. The organs squirmed around covered in slippery blood. Squirm, squirm. It was hypnotizing. 

“Ah there it is, just cut this part here.” I was holding the blade, making it my responsibility to end this frog's life. Would it feel pain? It twitched. Like a doll having its strings cut, it laid on the cold metal tray unmoving. Ann held its heart with her tweezers. “Huh, look at that. It looks like a human heart.”

 “Could you move? You’re blocking the sun.” 

He had been standing there for a while now. Resting his hands on the knees while looking at me. Wearing a simple shirt that was free of wrinkles and stains, and pants that seemed to be hand-tailored to his body, he really gave off an air of a pretentious young lord. His hair was neatly cut, the tips curling into themselves as they sat on top of his head.

“My apologies, but don’t you find this to be more comfortable? You don’t look like the type of person that enjoys the sun.” My pale arms stuck out of my clothes.

“You’re kind of rude.” He was a head taller than me as we both stood facing each other. 

“Haha, people do often say that my comments are sometimes rude, but be assured. I didn’t mean anything by it.” The corners of his mouth went a smidge higher. “I’m Halo, may I have yours?” He bowed like a gentleman, not even hiding the fact that he was a noble. 

Halo. Like that golden ring above an angel's head? I would have believed it hadn’t it been for the golden circle telling me that his name was a lie. 

I pinched the hem of my dress and gave him a curtsy. “I’m Esther, I won’t tell you my age however.” Raviel told me giving one’s age, especially a lady’s was something I shouldn’t do. 

“Interesting.” He rubbed his chin. “I thought I knew all the noble children residing in the capital.” What did he mean by that? Was he dangerous?

“Oh, I’m not someone suspicious.” He said suspiciously, holding his hands up. 

“Who are you?” 

“I’m Halo. But I have a feeling that’s not the answer you want.” He tapped his cheek a few times. “I just wanted to talk to a young lady poking frogs for fun.” It was the truth.

“That sounds stupid.”

“It does, doesn’t it?” He scratched the back of his neck with a shy expression.

Halo would sometimes take a stroll through this park whenever he had the time. Today, he chanced upon a light blue dress crouching in front of the frog pond. Her dress contrasted with the dull greens and the dull browns making her pop from the background. A little cloud, she looked just like one.

Approaching her was a simple task, as she didn’t even notice his heavy footsteps, he made sure to stomp them louder than usual. Scaring girls younger than him was not a hobby of his. It took an astonishingly long time before she stopped poking the poor little creatures, only because he had blocked her sun. 

Thinking that she was some peculiar commoner girl, he wanted to pick her brain for a bit. Talking to commoners widened one’s world view, which a few nobles would benefit greatly from. Some faces surfaced as he thought about them.

But suddenly, as a response to his greeting, the girl gave a perfect curtsy only used by high ranking nobles. Riffling through his memories, no noble child appeared to fit her description. Her name wasn’t even in his catalogue. Esther. Blonde hair, purple eyes, shorter than the average height, wearing gloves. None of the keywords matched a singular person.

Halo had met them all and in doing so, remembered them all. It was impossible for him to forget after all.

The mysterious noble girl frowned at him, in fact, even when she said it was fun poking the frogs, her face didn’t appear to be in sync with that statement. He wondered what she would look like with a smile.

“Do you want to see something fun?” It was a chance to know who she was.

“Fun?” Tilting her head to the side, the golden strands flowed gently to the side. “Are you going to abduct me?”

“Pfft\! What?” Was she serious? “Why would I abduct you?”

“Just say yes or no.”

“Uh… then, no?”

The girl stared at him. Her eyes bore into him, piercing into a singular spot on his lips. Was there something on them? Rubbing his lips, nothing appeared on his fingers. 

“Fine, show me.” 

“Good, give me your hand.”

“Why?”

“So I can hold it.”

“Here.” That was surprisingly easy. The girl was all over the place, one second she called him an abductor, the next she gave him her hand with no hesitation whatsoever. Did she really trust him? Halo wouldn’t even trust himself if there was another him out there.

Holding her small hand, Halo focused on the air around him, it was sunny today, making it easier to collect the small fragments of light mana floating around. Deeming it to be enough, he injected the ball of mana into her glove. In a second, the wooden stain on her palm disappeared in a wisp of smoke. She followed it as the wind took it.

“You can use magic?” She raised one of her eyebrows.

“Sure can. Are you impressed?”

“What other things can you do? Can you make a fireball?”

“Why would I do that? It sounds dangerous.”

“Because it’s cool. I think.”

“You think?” He wasn’t familiar with fire mana, nor the other three elements for that manner. He thought showing off his cleaning magic would at least get an ‘oh’ or an ‘ah’ out of her. She was just standing there, still expressionless as ever. His ego was prickled.

“I can do something similar, wait a moment.” 

With even more fervor than before, he absorbed the light mana like a thirsty person. Compress it, spin it around to maintain its shape. It was his most advanced spell. The light orb.

An orb of light the size of two fists hovered above his hands. 

“Heh, what do you think about this one? Cool right?”

“Yeah”, she said. “That’s cool. So you can only use divine magic?”

Crackle, something shattered inside him. Divine magic was rare even among the few mages in the kingdom. And here was some frog-poking girl snubbing her nose at it. Not only that, she got the category wrong.

“It’s not divine magic, I used light magic.”

“Same thing, are they not? They both sparkle and are totally useless.”

“They both sparkle… totally useless…” Did a neighboring princess visit or something? Never in his life had Halo heard such ridiculous statements coming from someone, and many ridiculous people he had met.

“Esther\!” The ridiculous girl turned to the person shouting her name. It was an older version of her. Same hair color, same eye color, different body type. Halo had to quickly look away lest he did something not gentleman-like. 

“Mom\!” Bouncing toward her, the girl looked just like any other smiling girl. It stunned him for a second. 

“Oh, did you get another friend? Hello.” 

“He’s not my friend.” Esther grumped as she told what happened. Her mother smiled the whole time, listening to her babbling daughter. It was interesting, he had expected some haughty noblewoman based on her daughter’s personality, not some refreshing lady nodding along with her daughter’s words. Riffle, raffle. He searched through his catalogue of nobles. A match was found. 

“His name is Halo, but it’s a fake name.” What? How did she know? He had perfected his poker face. Tricking even some of the smartest people in the kingdom. 

“Really? But don’t you think he has a reason for using a fake name?”

“Why would a child priest have a reason to hide his name?”

“Oh\!” The lady clapped her hands. “You’re a priest in training?” Setting the comment about him being a child aside, the lady’s expectant stare compelled him to agree with her.

“Mom, he’s lying again.” What trickery was she using? 

“Esther, you shouldn’t accuse someone of lying all willy nilly like that. Especially if they are your friend.”

“He’s not my friend.”

“I don’t mind being her friend.” Meeting this lady was interesting enough, but what he really wanted to know was the girl’s method of spotting his lies. They chatted for a bit more, debating whether or not he was her friend.

“Oh, dear. Look at the time.” the noblewoman said. 

It had gotten late. They said their farewells as they left the area. The girl glanced back at him a few times before disappearing in the horizon. He spotted some bodyguards trailing behind them. As he thought, they were some important people. Just learning that piece of information had made this a fruitful usage of his time. It was a wise decision to sneak out of the palace.

“Your highness\!” Speak of the devil, a brown haired boy ran up to him. It was always a wonder how his round glasses never fell off his face.

“Goodness, what is it? Did someone die again?”

“Yes\!” He straightened out his glasses. “But that’s not important right now\!” How horrible, someone had died and it wasn’t that important? “Do you know how much paperwork you still have left to do?” Ah. His aide reminded him of the boring work a prince had to do. 

Sign this document, sign that document. He should teach his aide how to forge his signature. 

“Your highness\! You really need to stop sneaking out, I beg of you\!” Poor fellow, he should have gotten familiar with his work life balance by now. 

“Walter.” He patted the shoulders of his aide. “Who am I?”

“Huh? You’re your highness?”

“Not my title.”

“Hylon Guillain?” 

“That’s right.”

“No, no no no.” It was always fun seeing his panicked state.

“I order you to find out all the information you can about that girl I was talking to.”

“What? Who? Why?” 

“Personal information, Esther Nikodemus, and because I’m interested in her.”

“Your highness\! I don’t have time for this\!” His glasses nearly fell down from his face.

Halo massaged his weary aide’s shoulders and gave him a warm bright smile. “I believe in you.”

“Please don’t\!” His voice made the birds take flight, flapping their wings over the setting sun. 

“Oh, and one more thing.” He asked the aide who had fallen to his knees. “Find out whether she is going to attend the royal academy or not.”

# Chapter 23: Grandmother

“What if grandmother wakes up?” I was currently sitting in the Duke’s office, having an afternoon snack with the patriarch himself. My parents had taken a carriage on the first light, leaving me to wander around the estate by myself for today. And wander I did.

“Good morning, miss.” Sir Alden greeted me. He was as tall as he was old. Clad in a suit, a chain hanging from his breast pocket shook as he put back the pocket watch. “Is there anything I can assist you with?” 

Not really. I have been here long enough to explore all the rooms and halls this estate had to offer. Thinking back on it, our house really felt small. A cozy small house or a huge estate with enough doors to build that very same house, I wonder what Karrie would choose. 

“Have you been to the portrait room yet?”

“There’s a portrait room?”

Tottering after the strides of sir Alden, we arrived at a giant locked door. It looked the same as the one protecting the Duke’s office. A blooming rose was engraved on this one too. I traced my eyes around the sharp thorns connecting to it’s stem. 

“Are you sure that I’m allowed to be in here?” It looked ominous.

“I think some great news will find you today.” The butler replied with something cryptic as he unlocked the door. A loud clack, then a creak. It didn’t sound like this door had seen much use. 

I thought the portrait room would have a portrait or two, or at the most six or seven paintings. Even that had been a high estimate, I thought. Littering all four walls of the room were paintings covered in a white cloth. It wasn’t feasible to count them all. 

The only ones that were uncovered were these in front of me. Even in his younger days, he looked just as mean as he did today. 

“Surprising isn’t it? His face would always make the young lords and mistress break out in a cry.”

Sitting at the top was the Duke and Duchess. Below them were their children. My uncle and aunt. A faint mark stained the wall where a third portrait would fit perfectly. Below those two portraits were even more portraits. 

“Those are Lord Gregor and Lady Grace’s children. I can still remember their laughter filling the hallways.” 

Black. They all had black hair. My uncle and aunt, and even all my cousins. They all looked the same. 

“That’s why I am so thankful for you, miss. It has become much more lively here ever since you arrived.” He gave me a neat bow. 

My father’s missing portrait, and my mother’s hair color. Was I the reason why they had dreaded coming here? I could still vividly remember their look as they read the letter telling them to come back. Surprisingly, nothing happened.

We arrived and the staff treated us with the most respect. I didn’t know what I had expected but that wasn’t it. Besides from the first day, when my father told the news about grandmother, my parents looked to be in better health.

Training with the knights, my father’s muscles bulged even more, and my mom would always smile as she took a bite out of her dessert. 

“Where’s my father’s portrait?” I prodded sir Alden for an answer.

“I’m afraid it’s not my place to say.”

“You must have brought me here for a reason.”  

“Call it a whim if you will.” I turned my attention to the portraits again. Why wasn’t my hair black?

“There you are, Alden. What are you doing here with my granddaughter?” The Duke called me that lately. It was far better than getting called ‘girl or ‘you’ all the time. 

“Greetings, your Grace.” I curtsied.

“At least you remembered this time.” His rough voice shook my hair. “Alden, bring some refreshments to my office. You, follow me.”

Rarely did I converse with my grandfather as there was no real reason to. He would sometimes be spotted sauntering in the garden but that was it, all his time was spent in the office scribbling on some papers or attending to the Duchess. I wonder when she will wake up.

“What if she wakes up? Maybe I will kick you all out again.” My spoon stopped shy of cutting into the jiggling pudding. Mine seemed to be a bit larger than the Duke’s. Did he mean that? “Hmm, it was a joke.”

“Why did you kick out my parents?”

He sipped on the cup of tea in silence. “Because It was the right thing to do.”

I thought back on my first mother. Being on the receiving end of her wrath, I couldn’t really see any reason for kicking your own child out. Perhaps because I was a child, seeing it from her perspective felt alien. Would I also kick my own child out in the future? 

The pudding was long gone and the teacups had lost their steam. Still, we sat there, in the cold oversized office without saying a word. He was staring in the air while resting his arms on the old couch creating bulges in the soft fabric where his hands gripped it. A tear would probably form there if he put in a little more strength. With nothing else to do, I mirrored his pose. 

“How old are you now?”

“I turned fourteen this year.”

“You will attend the royal academy next year then.” 

“The royal academy?” I straightened my back.

“Your family will now hold the title of Count from tomorrow onwards. Go prepare for the entrance test.” 

Feeling the giant door behind me, I thought back on what Raviel, my tutor, told me. 

“All noble children are required to attend the royal academy once they are old enough. It’s a policy the king himself made to foster positive relations between the different aristocratic houses. It also doubles as the time when independent thoughts can be formed, boosting the intelligence of our kingdom.” 

“So it’s a kind of school?”

“School, that sounds a bit simple, but yes, the academy is a kind of school.” She went on to tell me about the entrance test. Depending on one’s proficiency in several subjects, such as culture, statecraft and even debate, a class would be assigned according to your score. Oh, high scoring students even got a private room.

Dormitory life. Sharing a room with a stranger. It sounded silly. Standing outside the Duke’s office, I resolved myself to study hard.

“Ha…” Studying, school life. I wonder how it will go this time.

“I can’t believe I’m a Count now. How does it feel, my Countess.” He swooped mom into his arms. Light fluttered around the room like stars as it bounced off the silky dress. He pulled her body closer, pressing her body against him. Staring into his eyes, she pressed a finger against his open lips.

“Gale, you’re such a bad man.” He kissed her finger in response.

“Does that make me a bad Count then?” He took her hands in his own, swinging her around and around as they danced to the rosy atmosphere.

Imaginary hearts could be seen above them as she let out a giggle. “That depends on your actions tonight– Ah\! Esther\!” Like a child touching a hot pan, she pushed away my father with impressive speed, making him fall over. “H-how long have you been here?” 

Peeking around my mom’s figure, I saw my father still lying on the parlor floor. Did he pass out? 

“Mom, he’s not moving.” 

“That’s not important right now\!”

“I’m not important…” I eyed my father’s pitiful state.

“Well, I do feel that it can be a good experience, you don’t agree?” said father.

“You don’t know how ruthless nobles can be, what if she doesn’t fit in with them?” Mom rubbed her knuckles. 

“We have a year to prepare, do we not? Even that woman said she was progressing in her lessons at a remarkable pace.”

“I don’t know…” Another plate of pudding had been served to me. It squished between my teeth. “What do you want to do, Esther?”

“I think it sounds fun.” 

“Then it’s decided isn’t it?” 

“Are you sure about this?” I mean, I had expected this ever since our planned week-long stay got extended indefinitely. Our house back in Barre was actually starting to fade out of my memories. Which tree had been in our backyard again? Were the plants in my room all dried out by now? The only vivid memory was the smell of medicinal herbs. 

I thought back on the actors in that play again. The heroine was just like me, a commoner suddenly finding themselves becoming a noble. She pranced around gleefully at the royal academy meeting all sorts of people. 

The heroine was just like me, a commoner suddenly finding themselves becoming a noble, learning all sorts of things and finally having a chance to attend the royal academy. Seeing her prance around all happy and cheerful, there didn’t seem to be any downsides. Becoming a noble meant getting ahold of money and money was what truly ran the world. 

Thinking about it, why were our situations so similar? A shiver ran down my spine as I pondered further. A coincidence. Much like how meeting Karrie and Alice in this world was a coincidence. It better be, my Goddess.

“Esther?” Right, mom had asked me a question. I was more worried about her actually. Before my answer left my mouth, before my words of reassurance reached her, the door flew open with a bang.

“My lord, my lady\!” Sir Alden must have ran all the way to be so out of breath. “The Duchess has woken up\!”

The Duke held his wife’s hand. “Rosalynn, how are you feeling?” His look was similar to how my father would sometimes look at mom.

“Couldn’t be better.”

“Please don’t joke around, dear.” He pressed the back of her hand to his forehead.

She caressed his face. “I’m fine, Garius.” I understood why that maid always giving me candy said that one line, ‘a person that says they feel fine never feels fine’. Sitting on the double-sized bed, she did not look fine at all.

Haggard hair that had once shone like silk was now sticking all over the place, each of the loose strands having a mind of their own on how to make it look the most messy. Her once pink cheeks were sunken in like a sick person, to be fair she had been sick, but the point still stands. It was completely different than how she was depicted on hair portrait. That person had brilliant blue eyes, the Duchess in front of me had cloudy gray eyes that looked like marble. 

“How long did I sleep?”

“Two months, you have slept for two months.” 

She stared into the air. “Has Galen come to visit yet?”

“I’m right here mother.” 

“Goodness, is that really you, Galen?” 

“Yes, I’m really here.”

Even with her terrible appearance her smile still lit up the room. “It’s good hearing your voice again, my son.” 

“I’m sorry for not visiting sooner…” His voice trembled.

“Son, are you crying? If you do that…” Not only were their eyelashes the same, the way their tears rolled down their faces was the same too. 

“You brat, how could you make your mother cry?” The Duke grumbled.

“I brought Victoria with me.”

“She’s here?” Her eyes shone like diamonds.

“It’s good to see that you are in good health, your Grace.” The bedside was cramped with all three of them standing in a row. Her thin fingers rested on my mom’s face. 

“Look how thin you have become. Are you eating properly? My husband hasn’t starved you has he?” The Duke cleared his throat.

“Garius.” A sharp voice cut through the air. “I better hear the kitchen prepare a banquet tonight.”

“The physician said you shouldn’t consume such foods right after waking up.”

“I want something sweet. Alden are you there? Tell the chef to bake a cake.” Sir Alden bowed and left to carry out the order.

“Rosalynn, why not wait a day or two?”

“Hush, my son and his wife have come to visit. It’s my duty as the Duchess to entertain them.” And here I was thinking that the Duke was the most stubborn person in the duchy. 

“Their daughter is here too.”

“Esther?”

The men left the Duchess’ room as she requested them to. My father looked shocked, not expecting himself to be shooed away. Her fingers tickled as she rubbed them across my face. 

“She looks just like you, Victoria.” 

“Thank you for saying that, your Grace.” Their smiles were really similar. My grandmother began pulling my cheeks.

“How long are you going to keep calling me that? It’s really soft…”

My mom giggled. “They really are aren't they? Lady Rosalynn.”

“Hmm.” She turned her eyes at me, staring straight into my own. “Hello, Esther. Do you remember me?” 

“I’m afraid she doesn’t.”

“That’s understandable.” She turned her gaze to the air. “How long has it been?”

“A little more than six years.”

“I see. Six, seven years then. You must have read my will I presume?”

“Yes, it was carried out today.”

“I’m sorry, Victoria. It must have anguished you greatly.” She lowered her head.

“Your Grace\! You shouldn’t bow your head to someone like me\!” The chair fell to the floor as she shot up.

“As a Duchess of the Guillain Kingdom, I, Rosalynn Nikodemus, want to formally apologize to you.”

“You don’t need to apologize\!”

“Nonsense\!” Her voice made my fussing mom stop moving. “Why can’t I apologise to my daughter? Victoria, you are and will always be one of my precious daughters. Please, never forget that fact.”

“Mother…”

Her face mellowed out. “Won’t you accept this selfish old woman’s apology?”

“Like I said, you don’t have to apologize, please lift your head\!”

“Ha… All these years and you are still the same. What is so important about my head?”

The atmosphere in the estate changed remarkably. Now that the Lady of the house had woken up, all the maids and servants were smiling. I didn’t notice it at first, but back when we had arrived only a few had smiled at us. 

Low murmurs filled the hallways as they whispered together, shuffling their feet across the soft carpet. It felt like the Duke himself had ordered them to be quiet so as not to disturb the Duchess. Walking down those same halls today, cheerful voices could be heard. 

“My lady. Are you meeting with the Duchess today?”

“Melissa, which one do you think she will like more?” The purple ribbon? Or the blue one.

“Why don’t you wear this one for today?” She held up a hairpin adorned with a glassy flower. A purple hydrangea.

“I don’t like flowers.”

“Really? But this one is really pretty.”

“You can have it then.” I gave her the purple ribbon to tie my hair. 

Sitting on the plate in front of me was my third serving of pudding this week. My grandmother had invited me to a tea party today. She looked much better than when she woke up. Her gaunt cheeks got some of its color back and her hair was done in a pretty bun. Aside from the few gray strands, she didn’t look like a grandmother. 

Sitting in the gazebo, a blanket was wrapped around her shoulders. 

“Is it good? Do you want one more? Raviel, how many more puddings do we have left?” She was acting as the Duchess’ personal maid today.

“I think Lady Esther has had enough pudding lately, your Grace.”

“Ridicoulous, how can someone have enough puddings. Do you want one more, dear?” She gestured her hands at my empty plate.

“I would be thankful for that, your Grace.” With the snap of her fingers, my fourth serving of pudding appeared in front of me. Raviel shook her head a bit.

“There is no need to be so stiff, you can just call me grandmother when it’s just us.”

“I don’t think the Duke would like that.”

“Try calling him grandfather once.” She winked.

“Grandmother, can I ask a question? What happened six years ago?”

A soft breeze flying through the gazebo ruffled my hair. The seasons were finally turning to spring. Blue skies and leafy trees, birdsongs and shining sun. 

“It was when I first saw you.” Rosalynn thought back on that day. It was raining heavily.

# Chapter 24: Past 

It was on a morning when birds chirped their little songs up in their cozy nests, the crickets filled the garden with a pleasant low hum, and the horses pulling the carriage snorted into the refreshing air. A little girl ran up to the Duchess and pointed at the thing behind her.

It was her second-born child. Standing under the warm sun, her legs peeked out from under her petticoat dress. Its vivid crimson color lit up the surrounding bricks, painting them in a soft red shade. Her daughter appeared to like the dress gifted to her at the start of the week, she had worn it a couple of times already. With a tone befitting a young ducal lady, she said. “Mother, who is that dirty girl?”

“Gwen, what did I say about such remarks?” Her sigh vanished into the ether.

“But, she’s all covered in filth.” Rosalyn had to woefully agree with her daughter. It was true after all. If you hadn’t known, then guessing that the girl currently hiding behind her poofy dress big enough to fit two of her, once had lustrous blonde hair would be the utmost unthinkable. 

Drab and frayed commoner clothes, stained with all sorts of liquids in shades of dirt. An emancipated face that was permanently affixed into a look of wariness. The girl’s hollow purple eyes darted around as if looking for potential dangers.

“She will be living with us for the time being”, I crouched down to her height, “Why don’t you say hello?” 

It took several rounds of bathing before the water turned clear and there was no point in saving her clothes, those went straight into the fire. Her cheeks turned pink as she simmered in the oversized bathtub. The bubbles reflecting the rainbow appeared to hold her attention. 

“Pretty, aren't they?” She turned her eyes toward Rosalyn. “Gwen used to be such a lovely little thing, but now she is all grown up, she says. I don’t think grown ups still sleep with their stuffed bunny plushie, right?” She didn’t laugh. Tough audience, she thought.

A year had passed and Rosalyn’s worries did not come into fruition. She had heard some stories from the tea parties she hosted. It was her duty as a Duchess to hold extravagant events as a way to point the other nobles in the right direction. 

What was once fashionable became stilted, and what was once considered wooden became new again. Honestly, Rosalyn only held the tea parties to sample new dessert recipes. The other stiff looking noble ladies could do whatever they wanted.

“Oh dear, did you hear what that servant I personally raised did?” An irritating voice to her right said.

“You mean the young lad you plucked up from the slums? I cannot fathom what moved you to do that.” A smacking noise filled with cake was to her left.

“My eldest whipped that thief black and blue, he had been caught stealing from the kitchen.”

“What did you expect? Even a stray dog won’t bite the hand feeding them. Good work to that lad. Say, how old is he now? You see my daughter…”

“Lady Gwen, wait for me\!” The two children were flitting around the hallways, filling it with much needed life.

“You’re so slow\!” She crossed her arms at the girl catching her breath. “How are you going to beat my brothers if you can’t even catch up to me?”

“Do I really have to? I mean, they are kind of scary…”

“Nonsense, those meatheads look dumb as a loaf of bread. Stand up\! One more lap around the halls.”

“My lady… I’m tired…”

A third voice rang out. “Hey\! No running in the halls\!”

“Ah\! Run\! The tutor is here\!”

It was a silly sight. Holding each other's hand, the two girls were being chased around by the elderly woman. Their laughter and giggles filled Rosalyn’s heart with much needed comfort.

The two pairs of heads, one black and one yellow, could always be seen together. As the years passed, the more like sisters they became. Playing together, attending lessons together and going out exploring the duchy together. They had even begun sharing their bedroom at some point. Never had Rosalyn imagined that her daughter would become such friends with her, it was like having two daughters. A smile crept on her face.

“Ugh…” Gwen laid flat on the tea table. “All the boys at the academy are so dreary…” 

“Surely there must be one that caught your fancy?” The once skin-and-bones girl replied while holding her cup of tea.

“Don’t even get me started…”

“What about the eldest son of that Marquess?”

“He’s too dumb-looking…” Gwen babbled on the table.

“The Count’s son?”

“He’s fat…”

“It appears that my daughter will find even the prince himself below her at this point.” She propped up her head with a hand.

“The prince? He’s too bright.”

“Don’t you like smart people?”

“I meant appearance wise. He’s bright like the sun, it’s hard to look at him.” She squinted. “Besides, I don’t want to be in someone's shadow.”

“I see.” Both our voices replied at the same time.

“Mother, are you sure she is not my real sister?”

“How rude.” Their laughter filled the gazebo.

Gwen nudged her elbow at the blonde girl. “And what about you? Anyone you fancy?”

“O-oh I don’t know. There aren’t that many to choose from.” Her voice was higher pitched than normal and there was no need to put her hands up.

Gwen narrowed her eyes. “Suspicous. I won’t let you fall asleep before you tell me.” 

Rosalyn always thought that the two of them would continue to be this close even after she turned old and gray. As her mother, she thought that her daughter needed someone like her. 

Gwen had grown up holding everyone at an arms reach, she could count on her hands the number of times she invited an acquaintance let alone a friend over for some tea. Her two sons were the total opposite.

“Galen, isn’t it time that you stop being picky about your food?” Like always, the two of them shot jabs at each other.

“How can I be picky about food if it isn't food?” Her youngest nudged the mushrooms on his plate.

“You are being rude to the chef.”

“You eat it then, Gilbert.”

“Father, you should scold him.”

“Just finish your meal.” Her husband didn’t even glance up from his plate. “Where did that girl go?”

“Dear, she has a name you know?” That girl or that child. Her husband alternated between those two depending on his mood that day. What a grump. It has been years since she began living with us and not once could Rosalyn remember him utter her name.

She could still picture the first time the two of them met. Like a rabbit standing in front of a lion, he stared her down with those oppressive eyes of his. She scolded him that night. 

“Alden, notify the seamstress that Gwen uses, send for the tutor too”

“As you wish, my lord.”

Did he really need to act like that all the time? Rosalyn would sometimes find candy deep in his coat pockets. And it was of course her favorite flavor, strawberry. How come she married such a silly man.

Did he really need to act like that all the time? The poor child nearly broke out into a cry. The months following their first encounter, she would sometimes find something unexpected in his coat. Deep in his pockets were several pieces of wrapped candy. All of them strawberry flavored, the child’s favorite flavor of course.

Peaceful days continued until her daughter knocked on her bedroom door one night. Lamp in hand, she opened the door at the incessant knocking this late into the night. Intending to scold her unruly daughter, she thought about what to say this time. However she couldn’t. Gwen’s face sparkled as pebbles ran down her cheeks. Some even dripped onto the floor as she didn’t care to wipe them away.

“Mother… I want my own room again…” Something must have happened between them.

Ever since that night, the usual chatter stopped reaching her ears. Silence had taken over like an oppressive veil. No longer did they laugh together, no longer did they go out together, it was even rare to see them in the same room.

With no one to talk to, her daughter began becoming more and more prickly. Perhaps her real nature, much to Rosalyn’s chagrin. Her worst worry had turned true.

“I’m sorry your Grace, but it is not my place to tell you what happened.” The top of her blonde hair did little to abate her frustration. 

“Then who if not you?” Her head went even deeper hearing the sharp tone.

“I apologize.”

The years after that were dreary. Her two sons were starting to have full-on arguments instead of light banter. The Duke was busy with running the duchy and her daughter was starting to behave erratically, always smelling of wine. It even made the times when her youngest disappeared into the night a small matter.

Did someone curse her family? It didn’t make sense otherwise. She prayed and prayed in the church in the backyard, but not a single thing changed. In fact, black dots began littering her vision.

“Gwen, don’t you think you have been drinking too much lately?”

“I can’t sleep otherwise.” She spat out, slumped in the chair, not caring in the least about her image. Why should she care if there was no one to notice? Her daughter’s comment rang in her head. Holding the overfilled glass of wine with decadence, Rosalyn wondered where she had gone wrong. At least she managed to get married to a decent man.

“What about your daughter?” 

“Heh, what about her?” She drank half the glass in one swig, letting out audible glugs down her throat. 

“How old is she now?”

Twirling the now empty glass with her fingers, rays of light scattered across her green dress. “Who knows?” She snorted.

Rosalyn thought back on the day the news about her pregnancy broke. Overjoyed of finally having a granddaughter, she prepared everything her daughter would need. Included were colorful toys, cute clothes and a handknitted little hat. Good news were hard to come by these days after all. 

Like a little girl again, she bounced towards her daughter’s room. She would temporarily live with them as her husband couldn’t afford to miss a day of work. It was a respectable business venture, but it left little time for family. That was to be expected.

She met the physician wandering in front of her daughter’s door. He was a trusty fellow, nothing bad would happen to Gwen with him around.

“My apologies, your Grace. But I don’t think it would be wise to visit her at this moment.” It wasn’t what she had expected him to say. What did he mean by that? Opening the bedroom door, Rosalyn couldn’t move a single inch over the boundary separating the hall and the room. 

Littered on the ground surrounding her like small rocks, were the letters her acquaintances sent to say their congratulations. Some were crumpled into jagged balls, some were torn in half without having been read, and some even had some teeth marks showing.

Standing in the middle of the white mess, her daughter held the pink baby clothes with a strange expression. Neither happy like when she was young, nor angry like when she had grown up, her daughter had a blank expression. Rosalyn closed the door without calling out to her and went back to her room to pray. Her vision was worsening at a rapid pace. She did not see her daughter leave the room that week.

One day, as if wrapping everything up in an ironic bow, everything came crashing down. It was raining heavily that day. 

The crackling fireplace did little to mask the raindrops thudding against the glass windows. Thump, thump, did someone accidentally turn her window into a drum? A roar cut through the drumming. It was her husband. Galen, her youngest child, was kneeling in front of them in the parlor. In his arms was a little blonde girl wrapped in a coat. 

He wasn’t alone. She looked at the woman kneeling beside him. It was the girl that had once hidden behind her dress. How time flies, she was a woman now. 

“How did this happen\!” The Duke’ bellow echoed in the cold parlor. The carpet was acting like a sponge, absorbing all the water drops that fell from them. Rainwater or tears it was all the same. “She’s not even an infant\! That’s a fully fledged child for Goddess sake\! Are you insane\!?” It had to have been a curse. It had to be.

“Father please, she’s sick\!” The little girl’s face was pale as ash. 

“And what do you want me to do about it? I don’t even know how old she is\!”

“S-she’s six, your G-grace.” Her teeth chattered, likely from running from who knows where all the way to here.

“Six\!” The duke stood up, you could see his veins bulging under the immense pressure, pulsating like small snakes. “For the last two decades, I have fed you, gave you clean clothes and even a place to stay\! You must have thought me to be an idiot, was it fun laughing behind my back\!?” She cowed under his fury. “Now you have even ruined my son\!”

“Garius, how about we calm down a little.”

“Rosalyn. Are you not angry?” What would anger help with in this situation? If that child still breathing over there was their granddaughter, then her feelings meant nothing. 

Rosalyn didn’t give it much thought when she asked for a whole year off that day six years ago. She wanted to go explore the kingdom, she said. Seeing the current state of the soul-crushing atmosphere of the ducal household, there was no reason to reject it. Maybe the trip would do her some good. It did. A year later, she was all smiles and filled with motivation.

“Father please just listen to me this one time\! Please let the priest heal her\!” 

“Get the hell out of my sight\!”

“Are you going to let your granddaughter die?\!”

“I don’t have a granddaughter with blonde hair\!” The thunder roared outside.

\*\*\*  
I waited for the Duchess’ answer. Staring into the air, she seemed lost in thought. 

“It may be better if you don’t remember that day.” She finally said.

“I see.”

“I didn’t see the resemblance that day, but you really do look like a younger version of your mother.” Again, she used a phrase involving her eyes.

“Can you actually see, grandmother?” She laughed. 

“Oh, how silly I must appear to be. I still haven’t adjusted my manner of speaking.” Her eyes bore into my own. They were deep like the ocean.

# Chapter 25: Letters

“Hello, Karrie. How goes life over there in Barre? I hope this letter finds you in good health. I try to be, but you know how it goes. 

Pudding was served after dinner today, have you tried it? It’s jiggly and cold and tastes like sugar.

Do you remember that blue-haired woman? She ended up becoming my tutor. Oh, I’m preparing for the royal academy. My days are filled with lessons on etiquette, history and even dance. It’s surprisingly fun, you should try it some time. 

I don’t know what else to write so here’s the end of the letter. See you next time.

From Esther Nikodemus.”

“To my friend Esther, or should I write Lady Esther? Imagine our shock when we heard that the one you were visiting was THE Duke Nikodemus? A week-long visit my butt. Besides the shock of your betrayal, everything has been great.

Eric came to visit on my birthday. That was fun, we even had a cake. I have never tasted pudding before but a cake must be tastier than that. Mine tasted like raspberries. 

His apprenticeship seemed to be doing surprisingly well, he wore some really fancy clothes. He said they were custom-tailored to his body? It was to promote his trustworthiness or whatever. With that face of his I wonder how he does it.

You have probably forgotten about us normal, plain commoners already, my lady. I still can’t believe that you are a real noble. How is it? Are you wearing beautiful dresses? Flowy skirts filled with frills and ribbons just like those actors wore on stage, just thinking about it makes me green with envy.

Have you attended tea parties yet? Or what about meeting with handsome men.” A dried stain was on the letter. “Oh how I wish some gallant knight or prince, I’m not picky, would come and save me from this boring outskirts town. Have you met the prince? I heard he’s around our age. Sigh…

Miss you, hope to see you soon. 

From Karrie.” 

“With the trees protecting the duchy from the harsh winds turning brown and withered, it appears that autumn has taken over with its unrelenting grip on life. Piles and piles of once green leaves, now all dead, may be observed as Sir Gardener wanders the grassy gardens with his rake. Like the Goddess collecting lost souls, he too, collects them.

Raviel made me read and write poetry lately. She said it was to build up my vocabulary, which means learning more words if you didn’t know. I’m currently reading ‘The princess and the knight of bread’, have you read it? I don’t think Raviel likes that book very much as she frowns each time she sees me with it. Mom seems to enjoy it.

The only tea parties I have attended were those with her Grace, the Duchess of the Guillain Kingdom. She prefers to be called grandmother, a shame, her Grace sounds much cooler. It has become too cold to hold them outside so we moved inside instead. 

I thought all nobles were like the Baron in Barre, but meeting my grandparents really widened my once commoner eyes. Grandfather acted all high and mighty, grumping at this and raising his nose at that, but he would sometimes give me candy from his pocket. They were strawberry flavored for your information. I’m actually eating one while writing this. I will ask the butler to send one together with the letter.

Grandmother would make even you shocked. To describe her in one word, she was silly. She told me funny stories from when she was younger, and would always have a piece of cake everyday without fail. I thought my sweet tooth came from my mom, but maybe it was because of her instead. She didn’t act like one of the most important ladies in the kingdom. Oh and she’s blind, I think.

Did I mention my personal maid yet? The paper is starting to run out so perhaps I can regale you with my thoughts and experiences next time instead.

Signed Esther Nikodemus.”

“Esther, that first part you wrote was just like how the Baron speaks. It’s amazing how you managed to write so much but say so little. 

Snow has started to fall here, making it harder to sneak out of the house. My mom would just follow my footprints and find me. Maybe I should try walking backwards next time. 

Carriages have stopped rolling down the roads, which made Eric and his family finally get to take a break. We made a snowman yesterday, it was round like my dad.

I don’t know if I’m supposed to write this, but his family was talking about sending him to the royal academy too. That’s what you are preparing for right? Apparently he was smarter than we thought. Some rich noble took notice of his potential and offered to sponsor him. It sounds fishy. Eric of all people having potential? Make sure to bully him for me if you happen to meet him. Give him a punch in the middle of his upper arm, that’s where it hurts the most. 

Esther… Who am I going to play with now? Where is my personal maid? It feels like all the people I know are moving away from me.

Oh, the candy you sent was really sweet\! I can’t believe you get to eat these things whenever you wish, send me more next time. And before I forget, Happy Birthday Esther\!” A lot of hearts and even a cake was drawn on the page. A half finished flower was crossed out in the corner. “It may be a bit early but letters take time to send don’t they? Better safe than sorry.

Much love, Karrie from Barre.”

“To my friend in the outskirts town, Barre. Your letter arrived a tad late, in spite of that, it made me happy nonetheless. 

With the help of the Duchess, my mom prepared a magnificent birthday party for me. A sea of plates, all filled with different cakes, cookies, pudding, and pastries filled the banquet table. Did you know we have different tables for different occasions? Well this one had enough room for two whole dozen people. 

I thought I had tasted my fair share of various desserts, but our chef must be a mage or something. A dessert mage. With his magic he created variations that even my mom hadn’t seen before. 

Oh, have you seen a gold coin before? It looks like this.” A gold circle was drawn. “I got some of those as a gift. Maybe I should send one so you can compare to my good drawing. How does it feel that your friend is some rich noble flinging their worth around? Raviel told me that I shouldn’t, that you wouldn’t like my charity. Ridiculous right? 

Maybe that’s why that noble you mentioned wanted to sponsor Eric. We met some of them trying to hide their identity a while back, I wonder if it was them. I think their name was Lavenza and Leon? Maybe I can ask him if he really is going to attend the same academy as me.

The day when I will be going to the capital is fast approaching. Much like how an actor performs on a stage, winter must too take its leave at the end. Giving the other seasons a chance to come and play. I will be in the capital when this letter finds itself in your hands.

Signed, Esther Nikodemus, daughter of Count Nikodemus.”

Someone knocked on my door. “Sweetie, are you finished with writing your letter?”

“Yup.” 

“Did you remember to pack everything you need? What about your books?” She was fussing while straightening out some of my hair. 

“Mom, Melissa already helped me to pack everything, you don’t need to worry.”   
   
“What if she forgot something? You need to always double check your things before leaving home.”

I opened my briefcase to ease her worries. An extra set of clothes in case there was a sudden downpour, my coin pouch filled with my birthday gold coins and my lucky silver coin. A jewellery case that required a key to open containing a ring with our family crest. My father chose a tree instead of a rose or another flower. 

Hidden under all that was an oblong box. Plain and boring, it was a dagger case. I got it for my birthday. 

“Galen, don’t you think a dagger is a bit dangerous?” My mom said that day.

“That’s why she will need it. Who knows when some scoundrel won’t know their place and try something.” He shook his fist. 

“Stop acting like some hoodlum, who would be stupid enough to touch someone bearing the Nikodemus name?” 

“Father, I don’t think you know how commoners really see us. Give them an opening and some of them won't hesitate to take it.”

The Duke grumped in reply. “Are you trying to lecture me?”

“Dear, it’s better to be safe than sorry right?” My grandmother took father’s side.

Slowly unwrapping the red fabric in the box, lifting it up and wrapping my fingers around the decorated handle, I had to smile. It fit perfectly in my hand. The ergonomics were beautifully adjusted in tune with the natural bends in my fingers. Did the craftsman study biomechanics? 

The shiny blade was double the length of the handle, a comfortable length for someone of my stature. I wanted to try giving it a go against the air, but my mom’s concerned face told me that I shouldn’t. Bummer, it was really well made. Two letters, T and K were engraved on the blade.

Standing with the repacked briefcase in my right hand, I looked to my mom. She had become shorter. My usual eye level at the top of her shoulder had risen to the tip of her ear. All that eating for the past year had paid off. Would I become taller than her in a few years? Something pricked my heart at the thought.

I gave the bedroom that I had used for a year a last lookover. The room was as large as the house in Barre. I wonder if someone else was using it now. My bed against the wall had its cover neatly folded. The closet was filled with impressive clothes and dresses in all sorts of colours, although most of them didn’t fit me anymore. And littered on the desk were pens, ink bottles and containers filled with powder. 

My face had gotten sharper and in the process, lost some of its childlike features. It was nothing in comparison to the portrait of my aunt, she was like a sword and I a butter knife. Still, it was enough to stop being called a child wherever I went. 

“I can’t believe it’s been a year already…” Did she reminisce too?

“Someone said that time flies when you have fun.” I said.

“Really? I wonder who said that.” She kissed the top of my hair. “Should we go and say our farewells to the others?”

I nodded.

# Chapter 25.1: Melissa

Greetings, I am Melissa, a maid working in the ducal Nikodemus house. The work here is hard but also rewarding. Getting paid double the normal salary is rewarding indeed. 

I have a friend working with me, her hair looks like braided bread so everyone of us calls her the bread girl, I think she likes the nickname? Anyway what I really want to talk about is the young lady that has been staying with us, goodness how can someone be so cute\!

Her cheeks are so soft… I just want to squish them whenever they get filled with cake\! A squirrel, she looked just like that animal. Not to mention the things bread girl is teaching her. Oh my gosh. I don’t think my heart can take any more of their silly antics.

Did you know what happened? Her previous personal maid, Alice, ugh, got fired and of course her position went to me. Karma sure is sweet. Picking out the young lady’s clothes has been some of my most enjoyable activities lately. With pretty blonde hair and soft purple eyes, everything looks good on her. 

The rumours saying that she is a commoner doesn’t make sense. I mean, just look at her\! How can someone like us look that pretty? Saying that she didn’t like flowers as an excuse, she even gave me an expensive hair pin without hesitation. 

One sad thing is that she doesn't really smile that often. She would easily be able to take over the world if she did. 

Oh, someone is calling my name, see you next time\!

A knight-in-training stood in front of me. I think his name is Ronald? His grassy green hair flowed refreshingly in the breeze.

“Melissa, why are you acting this way?” Well, who starts a conversation like that?

I made my voice sharper than usual and crossed my arms angrily at him.  “What do you mean? How am I acting?”

“Like you haven’t read my letter…” He scratched the back of his neck. 

“What letter?” The only letters addressed to me were from my family back home.

“The letter I gave you?”

“Again, what letter? What did you write?” Huh? Why is he blushing?

“Here, I wrote another one. Please read it.” 

Huh. Huh? Huh?\!

# Chapter 25.2: Investigation

His wife was pushed down the stairs? The duke didn’t believe his ears. 

“Dear, I’m not that incompetent to fall down some silly stairs.”

“Who did it?

“It was a female voice, that’s all I remember.”

On that day, all current residing people in the ducal house, whether they were a guest or not, were lined up in the garden in front of the estate. They would stand there until the culprit was found.

The commander’s sharp voice cut through the frigid air, silencing their murmurs. “All males\! Take a step back\!” 

The servants and knights let out a sigh of relief. They would still keep their head for today. A young maid lifted her head to look at the Duke but had to immediately shoot down her gaze at her own shoes. There was a reason why the Duke had become one of the most powerful men in the Kingdom.

“What’s the next step, your Grace?” 

“Remove everyone that was hired the last two months.”

Taking the book that listed everyone working in the estate from Alden, The commander shouted their name in order. A small number of maids relaxed their shoulders as they took a step back. They too, would keep their heads today.

The process continued as the Duchess forced her brain to remember that day. And in the end there were only two people left. A young maid with braided hair and an elderly kitchen maid.

Murmurs rumbled in the background as sweat rolled down their backs. 

“You.” The duke asked the young girl. “Go greet the Duchess.”

“G-greetings, y-your Grace.” 

Rosalyn shook her head. “You can take a step back, sorry about this.”

“Margaret, greet the Duchess.” 

The elderly woman fell to her knees. “It wasn’t me\!”

Staring down at her, the Duke repeated his order. She had to do it.

“Greetings, your Grace… Please believe me…” She began to sob. He asked his wife if she was the one that had pushed her. It wasn’t. 

“Margaret, you can stand up.”

“Alden, who is missing from the lineup today.”

“That should be everyone, my lord.”

“Nonsense, check again.” Doing as told, he flipped the register containing everyone’s name and position. 

“There is one person missing.”

“Who is it?” Alden handed him the book. There was one person that had their name crossed out. Female. It was the girl that had foolishly taken her own life. 

Garius felt his anger rise thinking about the cover up he had to do after that stormy night.

“Find her family. Do it by today.”

That day, when the sun hadn’t even begun to sink in the horizon. A whole family disappeared from the kingdom as if they never had existed.

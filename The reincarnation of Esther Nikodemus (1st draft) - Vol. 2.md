**Chapter 27: The Capital**
===========================

tk slums, on the way to the dress store for an uniform.

dress gets commisioned first, then you get to know if you passsed, 1, either they wear their uniform when taking the test. 2 they wear their uniform after taking the test.

Charcot, capital city of the Guillain Kingdom. A magnificent place filled with even more people and buildings than the duchy. Standing like a lighthouse on the edge of a cliff, the palace, where the King himself and his royal family lived, made its presence known not by its thick impenetrable outer walls and gates, or it’s daunting high towers, but by the luster of its brick. Bright yellow. Almost fading into the background of the high sun hadn’t it been for the dark roof sitting on top of it as if to reassure us that The Golden Palace, was in fact, still there.

However, even when I focused my eyes to the far-standing glob of gold, it didn’t help to diminish my nausea. A year of studying and preparation did not help against the feeling of sitting in a carriage, if that carriage sat of top of another carriage driven by a drunk horse. The wobbles from the magic gate warbled behind me.

“My apologies, my lady, but the boutique is quite far.” Melissa’s figure glimpsed between my bangs. “We have to take a carriage.”

Scratch that earlier analogy, imagine three carriages stacked upon another.

I couldn't even care right now that my sitting posture was less than that of a commoner, why should I when these stiff seats didn’t care about me? Melissa sat opposite me with an expression that wanted to say something.

“I wonder how the uniforms will look like.” A purple hairpin adorned her hair.

Prestige and honor, that was what the uniforms represented. A person donning them had to act in a manner as not to sully the name of the Royal Academy. Each set was custom-made, hand tailored by a few select stores and boutiques. The one we were shaking towards was recommended by my grandmother. My aunt had apparently used this one in her younger days.

I had found it quite odd that one had to take one’s size and order an uniform before even taking the entrance test. They weren’t cheap after all, especially if you were a commoner like Eric. The reason? To make it hard for them to even consider taking the test. It was also meant to humiliate us nobles should we fail and not pass. So much for raising the Kingdom’s intelligence, mister King.

This district looked to be about fashion judging by the numerous clothier’s and tailor stores passing by. Mannequins bearing their proudest work stood displayed in the windows. Some had flowy dresses and some had tight suits. The horse finally stopped trotting at a building that looked no different from the others.

Entering the boutique with a soft ringing bell coming from the door, a familiar face welcomed us. “Gosh, look how much you have grown!” It was the seamstress I met the first time I entered the estate. And much like how I felt like a doll that time, the seamstress went quick to work.

Arms to the side. Arms in the air. Leg this way. Leg that way. Melissa was watching all this with a sparkle in her eyes.

TK

“Do you have any gloves that only cover the fingers and knuckles?” These daytime gloves that covered the whole hand made my palm too clammy in this hot weather.

“A glove that only covers the fingers… Why what a novel idea! Assistant! Bring me a pencil and give our patron \_\_\_ tk”

Exiting the building, a shout rang out. The sun was still high in the sky, acting like no time had passed at all. A fact that was honestly surprising. I thought we had been in there for far longer. Perhaps the speed was credited to their expertise, no wonder the Duchess still remembered this quaint tailor after all these years. Oh, someone fell to the ground.

“Guard! Are you even doing your job properly!? How could you let this beggar grab onto me!” The middle-aged man apologized and bowed his head.

The beggar raised himself on his knees and said with slovenly voice. “Please.. Just a copper will do…”

“A copper this time and then two the next! Shoo! Off with you!” The young nobleman said not so gently.

As if his future depended on it, the dirty boy crawled after him, not caring in the least that the hard cracked pavement scratched at his knees. Begging and pleading to the blue haired boy had little effect, he hid behind his guard.

Memorizing the most important nobles and their children in the kingdom had been one of the lessons I had with Raviel. This was to prepare me for the academic life, meeting some of them would be inevitable after all. She said that first impressions were more important than even, doubly so when meeting a higher ranked noble. Marquesses, counts, viscounts and even some rich barons. He was not one of the people I saw in the book of nobles.

This was a busy street with enough passerbys to fill my old room, but not one person. Not a single person as if staring would turn their own eyes dirty, turned their head to the beggar’s plight.

I ignored the common disturbance and ascended my carriage that stood in front of the boutique.

Melissa sat herself down opposite of me again, resting her back against the direction we were traveling. It was incredible really. How could a person not be affected by the sight? I may be a special case but I would like to think that a normal person would at least feel something. I mean, how could she just be sitting there. In her eyes, the carriage would be going backwards.

“Shouldn’t we have done something, my lady?”

“Why?” The unexpected comment made my voice sound a tad angry.

“S-sorry, forgot I said anything…” You shouldn’t lower your head, Melissa. Doing that will only make the feeling worse.

“Why do you think we should have done something?”

“I mean… Because its the correct thing to do?” Her eyes met my own. A split second later, both her hands shot to her mouth.

I scoffed. “The correct thing you say?”

“My lady, I didn’t mean—”

“Enough.”

My elbow, resting on the cold surface of the carriage window, did not move an inch. I clamped my mouth shut with my hand, lest the bitter taste crawling inside would spill out.

The ride back to our lodging was quiet.

  

**Chapter 28: Entrance test**
=============================

A new day. A new room. A new bed. Although there were two of them, it felt comfortable enough under my body. Nothing like the one I used before getting assigned this dorm room. I thought back on that morning.

Sleep did not come easily that day. The bed or rather what looked like bed but felt nothing like it, had made it’s sole purpose of existence to attack my back. Turning to the side only made my arm numb and sleeping on my stomach felt wrong. Maybe I had been spoiled by our estate’s bed, not that it mattered in this moment.

I finally managed to get a wink of sleep. But immediately, a knocking sound from the door woke me up. It was already morning.

“My lady, you have to prepare for the entrance test!” The muffled voice of my always so faithful maid filled me with inane thoughts. I was already irritated.

  

With the soft mutterings of the carriage horse at my back, I stared dazedly at the gates of the royal academy. If I were to describe the palace as a ocean that connected two continents, then this was the sea that was the size of a country. In other words, it was huge.

A main building that stood in the middle with two wings stretching to either side. Several floors of windows glinted in the sun blinding me in the eyes as I craned my neck to even peek at the dark roof. I imagined from a bird’s point of vision that it looked to be formed like an H.

Turning my head to either side, the dormitories could be seen. Left one for girls, right one for boys. It reminded me of the annex our staff lived in. Flat walls with an equally flat roof. Focusing my eyes, silhouettes of people could be seen flitting behind the windows. Must be student’s that hadn’t taken their break.

The courtyard was filled with the refreshing smell of evergreen leaves and neatly cut grass. Soft shadow’s painted the ground with pleasant shapes and hues. The clacks coming from my shoes beat on the paved path that looked more akin to a road. A long road. I considered sitting on one of the benches but all of them had flowers stationed around them. Melissa let out an exclamation when we finally reached the entrance stairs.

Just thinking about walking up those steps everyday for the next few years already made my aching feet ache even more.

“I can’t believe that I get to see these famous grand steps in person.” She wore a practical dress today, nothing too formal like the black and white uniform she used in the duchy, nor the extravagant silk dresses that my grandmother liked to use. Holding my briefcase, she could be mistaken for a noblewoman or at the least a rich merchant’s daughter.

“How are these steps famous?” I asked.

“My lady, how can you not know about them? They say that each of those steps represents one’s stage in life. The first step is birth, the second is childhood.” She had raised two fingers.

“The last step must be death then.”

“That’s why these steps are so famous, the last step is birth again. No one truly dies while the Goddess is watching over us.” She beamed.

“Interesting.” I skipped over the last step.

  

A woman clad in what must be the academy’s uniform greeted us. “Welcome to the royal academy, are you here to take the entrance test? May I have your name?” She was reading through some document in her seat.

“Esther Nikodemus.” She stood up from her desk.

“O-oh, let me show you the testing area.” And so we followed after her. The hallway looked as grand as the outside. Paintings of nature and portraits of the previous headmaster’s filled the walls. A room that looked like a lounge was our destination.

“Where are the others?”

“Today’s test is not for another hour, should I bring out some refreshments?”

“No, it’s fine.” She bowed and left the room.

“The staff is so polite here,” Melissa said.

It was weird. My father was just some new Count that hadn’t even received a territory yet, was all nobles treated like this in the academy? I thought this place was to give us a broader world-view by treating everyone the same.

“Did we arrive too early, Melissa? There’s no one here.”

“It’s perfect for doing some last second reading isn’t it?”

I plopped myself down on the surprisingly comfortable armchair. “I guess… I think I will rather take a power nap.”

“My lady, I still don’t understand why you consider napping as something powerful, should I wake you up as usual?”

I didn’t have enough time to answer before I clocked out.

\*\*\*

“Okay class, we have a new transfer student today, make sure to give her a warm welcome.” If stares and whispers were warm, then I must be burning right now. I gave a introduction that included my name and a fun fact.

“Lets see, you can use that desk over there.”

A girl raised her hand. “Teach, that seat is already taken.”

“Well, then they shouldn’t have skipped class today, should they? Speaking of where are they?”

The desk was at the back by the window. The girl that had raised her hand was my desk neighbor.

“Nice to meet you—”

“Hey.” She cut me off. “That seat is already taken, take a hint will you?”

“Ann, what did I just say?”

I dragged out the chair, letting out a grinding sound as it bounced across the floor. Then I sat down.

The girl scoffed.

\*\*\*

The same woman guided us out to the hall again. It looked like a proper school now. Eyes that were filled with confidence juxtaposed against the slumped shoulders and sighs of others. I could hear some murmurs saying , ‘I should have studied more’, and prayers to the Goddess.

We were being led in a room filled with only chairs and desks. Finding a free seat at the back, a single charcoal pencil laid on the otherwise monotonous wood surface. A tall man bearing an uniform entered the room after all of us had taken a seat.

“Welcome to this year’s royal entrance test, I will be your examiner today and there is just one thing I want to say.” He leaned his body forward on the podium. “Don’t even think about cheating. Each of your desks is outfitted with magic technology that will give out a signal should even a smidge of mana be detected. No magic pens, no sound transferring magic circles, no nothing. For the next four hours, the only thing that will be on your desk is that charcoal pen and a copy of this.” He smacked the stack of papers. “Is that understood?”

A boy raised his hand, his blue hair was familiar. “What if we finish before the four hours are up?”

He crossed his arms. “I will award you a medal of knowledge”

Whispers filled the room. “Aren’t those only given to top students and scholars? I didn’t know it was that easy.”

“Are you even hearing yourself? How can it be easy?” Another whispered.

The blue-haired boy lowered his hand. “I will remember that comment.”

And so it was time to take the test. A year of studying, a year of preparation. It was all going to fill up this double sided paper. First question. TK

TK continue scene, maybe its easier than thought

What does the raisin symbolize?

‘What sound does a one handed clap make?’

TK

After answering everything, I glanced at the clock. It had only been two hours. Scritch. Scratch. Scribbling of pencil tips and tapping of pencil ends made the room sound like a room full of cicadas.

Picking up my paper, the grinding of my chair stopped the movements from the surrounding desks. Row by row, I trudged through the desks and silent stares. My neck felt like burning and someone even broke their pencil as a crisp snap cut through the otherwise droning sound of scratching. The examiner hadn’t moved from his spot as he held overwatch, only uncrossing his arms when I finally arrived in front of him.

  

Armen raised an eyebrow at the girl in front of him. “Are you giving up? You still have two hours.”

He had already found it ridiculous when a boy asked about the time usage. The test wasn’t some child’s play that could be realistically be solved in four hours. All the great minds of the academy had banded together this year to create what they called ‘The Impossible’, it was meant to show these naive kids an insurmountable wall.

Struggling and still not giving up was the real test. The scores mattered little as time accounted for the most points, the longer you sat, the more points you accrued. And the reason for giving up? It was to save face of course.

All scores would be publicly available to see on posters spread across the capital with the name, house and territory they came from. This meant that to avoid being humiliated for a failing score, it was deemed better to give up and try again the year after. Armen thought it was quite a system the headmaster had made, favoring the commoners with nothing to lose.

Yesterday’s batch had been beyond disappointing as a third of the nobles had given up. The pressure must have been too much for this stony-faced noble girl too. In a sense, it was honorable to be the first to admit defeat, it was a quality of a great leader to—

“I’m done.” What did she say?

Armen snatched the paper dangling from her gloved hands. Done? She must be joking. He retracted that thought upon looking at her face again.

Scanning through her paper, answers were written below the questions. All of the questions. Some of them even he couldn’t answer, but there it was, in plain handwritten letters that showed no hesitation or deliberation.

“Can I leave now?” He could only nod.

It wasn’t after she sauntered towards the door and disappeared that he finally remembered. It was a time test. She had already vanished when he went after her. Esther Nikodemus was written at the top of the paper. Maybe this year’s student’s weren’t so bad after all?

  

\*\*\*  
It was quite unfortunate that I didn’t score high enough to get a private room, but it wasn’t like someone died or anything. It was too much to expect to score high only after studying for a year after all. Yeah, at least we had separate closets and separate desks, what more could I ask for? The bed let out a fwomp as it caught my body.

“I hope my roommate is someone normal at least…”

Maids and servants were barred entry in the dormitory, which meant that Melissa didn’t come with me today. She had been quite excited when she saw that I placed over the average and made me dress in my finest today. What was the point? My uniform should be ready this afternoon. She really did the most eccentric things sometimes.

Knock! Knock!

“Come in…”

A fluff of pink entered through the door. “O-oh hello!”

Black shoes that showed some scratches even with the exorbitant shine and polish. A soft brown skirt that went to her waist. A shirt that looked a tad too long with her sleeves crumpling at her wrist. Thin round glasses that sat over her blue eyes, and finally her cotton-pink hair that was tied up in a ponytail with a plain looking ribbon.

The luggage she dragged behind her looked to have gone through a war or two. It was a sure bet that this girl was a commoner.

I didn’t bother to raise myself from the bed as I greeted back.

“It’s nice to meet you, I’m Phila from Klippel, what about you?” She beamed.

“Esther, Esther Nikodemus.” She didn’t beam anymore. In fact, it looked like she had just killed someone. Gaping her mouth and widening her eyes, the luggage fell to the floor with a thud as she had let the handle go.

“I’m so s-sorry!” She bowed. “My lady!”

  

**Chapter 29: First impression and uniform**
============================================

Moments like these happened occasionally, especially when I traveled with the Duke and Duchess. It felt nice at first, like a famous celebrity taking a walk in the city, but the novelty fell off after a while. Watching the back of her head, I felt nothing.

“Why are you bowing to me? We’re at the academy.”

“Please don’t cut off my head!”

“I wouldn’t be able to even if I wanted. Raise your head.” Trembling like a newborn fawn, she did as told. “You don’t need to greet me like that at the academy, we’re all equal here.”

“B-but you’re from the ducal house…”

I sat up on the bed. “I think you got the wrong idea, my father is a count.”

“Oh, is that so?” She let out a sigh of relief. “Wait! That doesn’t make it better! Why are you here?”

“What do you mean, this is my room.”

“That doesn’t make any sense, why am I sharing a room with a noble!” She fell to her knees.

Doesn’t that hurt? “She’s loud.”

“Eek! I’m sorry!” Ah, my thoughts got mixed.

It took quite a while before her one-man comedy act stopped and the room was quiet enough to rest in. Her luggage contained some interesting things. Aside from her clothes, she had packed: TK, a romance novel that had a terrible ending, and even a single polished and round stone. She looked quite satisfied as she laid all her things on the floor in neat piles.

“So why did you say that earlier, you don’t want to share a room with me?”

“I thought I was going to share a room with another commoner…”

“I can leave if you want.” It was better to nip these things in the bud. Small conflicts often bred into larger ones if left untouched. I picked up my briefcase and went for the door. The dorm mother would probably grumble because of the request.

“Wait!” She scrambled to her feet behind me.

I held the briefcase in my right hand. Meaning that she only had another hand to latch on. My left hand.

\*\*\*

Phila was on cloud nine today. Skipping and bouncing around the courtyard she smelled the flowers, felt the leaves and rustled the bushy bushes. Why? Because she had passed the prestigious entrance test of course!

She couldn’t believe her eyes when the letter containing her name was sent to her uncle’s house. Actually, no one could believe their eyes. Not wanting to be one sour uncle that didn’t celebrate his niece’s incredible achievement, he held a family banquet in her honor yesterday.

Oh, the soft chicken, the incredible mashed potatoes and the sugary sweetness that was the cake from a patisserie! Just thinking about what she had eaten made her mouth water. Phila, focus! You can’t behave like a silly country girl just because you are! First impressions were really, really important. She pumped her fist in front of the dormitory room.

A pretty voice called out when she knocked. And a pretty girl she was. Even when lazing on the bed like a potato, it did not diminish her appearance at all. Silky hair that looked like threads of gold, purple eyes that were even more vibrant than the lavenders outside, and last but not least, her pretty dress! Was she some rich merchant’s daughter?

Phila was wrong. She was a noble. Nikodemus. Ah, one of the two Dukes in the kingdom. Phila was wrong again. Her father was a count. Right, one of the counts of the kingdom. That didn’t make it better at all!

However, she was surprisingly calm even when she committed all the faux pas’ she could. Maybe she was friendlier than she looked? Her stare was terrifying though. But not as terrifying as what happened next. She had grabbed the girls hand on reflex when she was about to leave.

Phila had attended a play once. It was a tragedy, something she didn’t particularly enjoy but her friend convinced her anyway. It was about a man that seemed to be the most unlucky person in the world, everywhere he went, misfortune found him. Cursing at the Goddess, he got put to the guillotine for something he didn’t do.

The actor playing him had made the scariest expression she had ever seen in her life. Phila felt her breath seize up when he attacked the audience with his gaze and landed straight into her own eyes. Sharp as knives, full of hatred and anger. The spotlight accented his pulsing neck veins as he spat profanities at the Goddess. A demon. That was what her friend had said afterwards. But even that paled in comparison to this girl. If the actor was a demon, then she was the devil herself.

“Unhand me!” She yanked her hand back.

Phila staggered back a step, it was intense. Her teeth were showing, all four canines clenched together. Sharp enough to kill. Her eyebrows were crushed together like the jagged mountains in the West. And her eyes. Purple and cold like the tundra in the North. It made her freeze up. No one had ever shown such hostility at her before. TK

Her mother had repeatedly warned her to be mindful of nobles. Make sure not to cross them in any way, she said. One wrong move and your future would be full of hardship. And here she was, touching one of them without permission.

Phila felt something soft in her hand. She had thought it was quite fashionable that the noble girl wore gloves even in this weather, she actually wanted to ask her about it. The glove in her hand was delicate and luxurious, beautiful stitches that cleanly separated the back and front-side of the flat fabric. A stark contrast to her naked left hand.

She let out a gasp upon seeing it. She didn’t do it because she wanted to, but because had to. It was horrible. Terrible and even the word disgusting surfaced to her mind before she could stop it. It looked like a dog had chewed on it, a dog that had not eaten for two weeks. Yet even that description did not accurately convey what she saw.

The girl quickly hid her hand behind her back and opened the door. However to open a door, you had to face it. All her attention was on her hand as she fled out of the room, leaving a booming slam as a parting gift.

Phila stood still for a while staring at the closed door. Then she looked at the glove in her hand.

A single tear rolled down the glasses-wearing girl as she slumped on her knees.

“I want to go home!”

  

\*\*\*

“My lady, did something happen?” The carriage rustled as Melissa and I were on the way to pick up the finished uniform.

“I met my roommate.”

“Nothing else happened?” I stayed silent. “Did you forget your other glove?”

“You’re asking an awful lot of questions today.” I ripped off my other glove, letting it slam on the carriage floor. “There.”

She picked it up and gave it a few pats before laying it on her lap.

“My lady…” What was she going to ask now? “Do you want some candy?”

She pulled out a wrapped ball from her dress-pocket. It was apple-flavored this time.

  

The soft clang of a bell announced our arrival.

“Oh my, welcome welcome! You don’t know how long I’ve waited for this day to come!” The seamstress dragged me to the dressing room before I could even greet them.

With a trained hand she stripped me clean in a few seconds. Her assistant folded the clothes in square piles each time she threw her another piece of my garments. Then she dressed me with a speed that rivaled even the seasoned maids at the estate. Alone at that.

“A masterpiece! Don’t you agree assistant?” Her assistant nodded furiously.

Taking a turn in the mirror, my skirt flowed nicely. Pleated and black in color, it shined a little under the warm boutique light. It’s length was modest enough cutting off around my kneecap. The white inner shirt wrapped around my body perfectly, and contrasted nicely with the brown blazer that was more breathable than it looked. A crest imaging a book and a sword laid atop another was embroidered above the breast pocket, above where the heart was.

It looked suspiciously like school uniforms of my past life.

Putting all the poems I’ve read and studied together, I wanted to reach into my heart and compliment the pair of experts that waited for me to speak.

“It’s pretty.” A simple single word often conveyed more than many, I think.

“It is isn’t it? Only the best fabrics and materials were used. Cotton from the South, mixed with wool from the East—” She went to describe each little minute detail. The weaving and dying process. The cutting and stitching process. She even went on a tangent and mentioned a delicious sounding dessert cafe.

“What’s the price?”

“Oh it’s already paid for, the Count said to not worry about the cost.” I hummed while giving myself a last look. It wasn’t the outfit I asked about, well, no matter.

“Oh heavens, assistant, bring out the thing!”

The assistant handed me a small square case . There was a pair of gloves inside. On the first look, it looked to have been cut in half. A glove that only covered the knuckles and fingers, it was exactly what I asked for.

The dark stretchy material in the same shade as my skirt fit snugly on my hand like a glove, or like the stockings I currently wore. My scars were covered and the dark color capturing the light even hid some of the bumps that protruded. Best of all, my palm didn’t feel clammy anymore.

“We had to use a new material from a monster as cotton and wool threads didn’t have enough spring to suitably prevent it from slipping off. How is it?”

“It’s perfect.” I had just said the idea on impulse last time, but they delivered something far better than what I imagined.

“Oh. My. Goddess. Assistant, we finally see her smile!” They looked like two children jumping and hugging each other. They were such a silly pair. Was it such an achievement that I smiled?

“Which monster was it?”

“Assistant!” Out of nowhere a drawing of an animal appeared before me. “Experimenting with the skin of a bihorned frog, we managed to weave a fabric a dozen times stretchier than the stretchiest thread in the kingdom!” She clenched her fist and stared into the air.

It was a frog with two horns, actually, it was antlers. Two deer antlers on a frog. Right, how silly of me to imagine a big spider or something similar.

\*\*\*

Picking up the rest of the luggage in the lodging, it was finally time to move to the dormitory proper. Circumstance had made me take another night at outside the dormitory. My personal smiled at me when I decided that for some reason. She had done my hair again today, letting it flow straight with a braid behind as an accent. I don’t think I can make it look like that by myself in the dorms.

More students were roaming in the hallways compared to this morning. It was cozy with all the bright greetings and chuckles coming from all of them. Even when class wouldn’t start for another week, all of them wore their uniform with satisfied faces. It made sense. I caught myself reflected on a window.

Glancing at my reflection on a window, it did look good.

Arriving at the door to my room, I stopped for a moment. Would Phila still be there? What should I say? I may have overreacted a bit yesterday, it didn’t actually hurt, it just shocked me is all. She even saw it. A sigh fell out of my mouth as I reached for the door handle. It opened inwards before I could turn it.

“O-oh, good morning…”

“Good morning.” She stood still like a log. Her uniform seemed to fit her better than yesterday’s clothes. It suited her.

“Have you eaten yet?” I replied with a no.

“Do you, uhm, want to eat dinner together?” Pressing the bottom of her glasses, she adjusted them with a finger.

TK show in a scene the results, esther is slight above average, Eric is top twenty and do some monologing or smt. fulfill her promise to karrie. Should estelle be the same year?, probably not, same age as lavenza should fit better. Can sixteen year olds in otome fantasy world have a fiance? idkk Maybe a ribbon or something to indicate that the uniform is for first year idkk

**Chapter 30: Cafeteria**
=========================

Food was served three times a day at the academy. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Today’s dinner was some baked potatoes adorned with various herbs. It tasted like butter.

Glancing up from my tray set with the plate, I noticed that Phila hadn’t taken a bite yet. It was as if she didn’t expect me to accept her invitation and only asked because that was what first came to her mind and now found it difficult to ask me to leave after the fact, or so her customer service smile told me.

“You don’t like potatoes?”

“No, I like them!” She shoveled a forkful of potato into her mouth. “Oh my gosh, it’s so good”, she whispered.

As not all the students hadn’t arrived yet, the tables were hard to fill up. Our table only had us two using it.

“You said you were from Klippel?”

She coughed before answering. “T-that’s right.”

“I see.”

“…”

“I’ve been there before. Klippel, that is.”

“Really?” Her eyes met my own momentarily before falling back down to her plate.

“Green teacups, that’s your specialty isn’t it? They were quite pretty.”

“Thank you…” She took another bite as if to tell me to stop asking her questions.

Thinking back, her asking me to join her for lunch did go against my expectations. But I had been happy that she asked. It meant that I wouldn’t need to share a room with someone who disliked me. Still, seeing the meek girl that only looked at her plate of potatoes, I wondered if it was really that easy.

“Do you know the town Barre? I have some friends from there.”

“That outskirt town?” She raised an eyebrow.

“Why, is it that surprising?”

“Honestly, yes…”

“What if I said that I’m from that town?” It wasn’t technically a lie.

“How would that be possible? I thought only a Baron lived there?”

“I was a commoner until just recently.”

She looked me up and down and smiled in response.

TK make phila apologize at the end somewhere

“Oh, is that you Esther?” A young man in uniform appeared before us. Long legs clad in fancy pants that stopped a little at his shoe, letting it fold over itself once. A shirt with arms that would have no problem reaching the top of the closet. The cuff buttons on the blazer glinted as he held a tray of food. And indicating that he was a first year like us, a redTK tie wrapped itself around his neck and down his chest. He must have done it himself as it laid a little crooked.

A year had passed and much had changed, and yet he still looked the same, a little taller maybe. Red hair that went all over the place. Green eyes that now contained a bit of wildness compared to before. And robust lips that were crooked like his tie.

“Long time no see, my lady.” He smirked with his chiseled face. Boys really did grow fast at this age.

“You’re interrupting our talk.”

“Yikes, a year has passed and that’s the first thing you say to me?” He sat down beside Phila and asked her: “Is this seat taken? I’m Eric by the way.”

“N-no go ahead, I’m Phila…”

“Eric, you should really stop with that habit.”

He crossed his arms. “It’s my character.”

“It’s stupid.”

“Ha… what’s with you and Karrie still calling me stupid. I placed top twenty in our class, you know?”

“I saw, congratulations.”

“Your nobleness still haven’t made you less aloof, I see.”

I softened my eyes. “It’s good to see you again.”

He smiled.

“Come here for a second.”

“Ordering us commoners around already?” Despite his jab, he went over to my side.

With the strength I had accumulated over the past year, I harnessed it all the palm of my hand. Then, as if to explode my own arm, I propelled my fist forward. Forward to where his shoulder was. No fanfare happened as it bounced right off his muscle, it was tighter than I thought.

“I guess that was from Karrie?”

“Tsk.” He really did have an annoying smirk.

  

“So its true? You just recently became a noble?” Phila asked when he sat back down. “How does that even happen?”

“Weird isn’t it? She was just like us a year ago.” Eric said as he began eating. His plate was double ours, combined.

“I mean, but she’s still a noble, shouldn’t we be more… Polite?”

“Polite? Didn’t you just see what she did? It’s fine isn’t it, my lady? This is the academy after all. Esther is not one to care about such things.”

"Just make sure to not forget to address me correctly in official events.” He gave me a salute.

“Finding out that your father is a Duke’s son…” Phila’s eyes sparkled. “You’re like a heroine from a play!”

“Hah, more like the antagonist.” I sent him a glare.

“And you have the highest score too!”

  

TKKKKTTKTKK

  

“What do you mean the top score? I only placed above the middle.”

“No need to be so humble.” She pulled out a leaflet. “Look at the top, it says Nikodemus right?”

“Yes it does. But that’s not my name.”

“Huh?” Phila pressed the page against her glasses.

“I think I know what happened,” Eric said. “To be honest, I had to take a double-take when I saw your surname at the top, but that’s your cousin isn’t it? Estelle Nikodemus.”

Estelle Nikodemus. In the whole year at the duchy, not once did I see her. In fact, not once did I see any of my other family members. My uncle and aunt, and my cousins. All I knew about them was how they looked and their age. Estelle was a six months older than me, born in summer.

“Our names do sound similar, but haven’t my name been mentioned enough to clear up that misunderstanding? And besides, having you as my roommate is proof that I didn’t get a top score.” Phila hung her head. “Is that why you acted that way this morning?”

To the general population, the fact that my father got reinstated back as a heir was relatively unknown. Meaning that Duke Nikodemus officially had two potential heirs. The first-born son, or the second-born daughter. Meaning that I, a new Nikodemus, wasn’t widely known yet.

“Sounds like something fun happened?” Her shoulder’s jerked at Eric’s words. “I know that she may seem scary at first, but get to know her, and you will see that she is actually very kindhearted.”

“I don’t think you should say that while rubbing your shin…”

My gaze met hers in the air, but nary a second later, she averted it. Actually, all this time while we conversed, she hadn’t looked into my eyes once. The juxtaposition between her slight slump, shoulders turned inwards, and his straight back, shoulders turned outward, made for a sorry sight.

We talked a bit more while Eric shoveled the rest of his plate of potatoes and as a signal that he was done, a clear ringing sound reverberated throughout the half filled cafeteria. A blue-haired boy looked shocked at his tray of food that laid on the floor. The poor baked potato rolled a few times, leaving its insides trailing behind it, before stopping at the feet of a tall boy that sat alone.

“Lucas, tell me, what is the meaning of this?”

“Oh, Siegfried. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to do that! Are you okay?”

“You expect me to believe that? It looked quite deliberate when you shoved your chair with enough force for my food to fly out of my hands.”

“I didn’t know that you were behind me… ”

“Right, because it’s my fault I didn’t stomp my feet loud enough for your failing ears to hear.”

“Man, I said sorry, didn’t I?”

“Saying sorry won’t make up for the fact that my food is sitting down there.” He pointed with his eyes at the floor-potato. “Or what, do you expect me to still eat that?”

“Why don’t you just go get another one? I can clean this up for you in the meanwhile.”

“Passing the entrance test must have gotten to your head, Lucas. Do you think this food here is free?”

“Well, it is, isn't it?”

“What did you say?”

The air around the two boys went down a couple degrees as the blue haired boy ground his teeth loud enough for even us to hear. He looked poised to throw a punch at the taller boy when someone grabbed his arm from the side.

“Siegfried, are you sure you want to get expelled even before the first official day?”

“And who the hell are you?”

“Me? I’m Eric. Nice to meet you.”

Phila looked back and forth a couple times between her left side, where he had been sitting, and at the trio of boys, where he now was.

“When did he get there?”

I sighed. “He’s like a dog chasing after fun things.”

“Should we do something?”

Siegfried yanked back his arm and gave his blazer a few pats to straighten it out. At this point, all the students eating in the cafeteria had their eyes trained on them. Siegfried clicked his tongue at Eric and Lucas, and went to leave. But not before saying one last thing.

“You better clean that up!”

“Yikes, who does he think he is?” He turned towards the taller boy. “Lucas was it? Are you all right?”

“Thank you, but you didn’t need to step in…”

“Are you kidding? He looked ready to kill.”

“I wouldn’t take it that far.” He smiled gently.

With the situation mediated, Eric dragged Lucas with him to our table and plopped him down on a free seat beside him. The three of them sat on one side and I, alone on the other. Was I interviewing them or something?

“So you three are also commoners? There are more of us than I thought.”

“Yes there are,” I said.

“The Royal Academy, where commoners and nobles are treated alike, but look at one of them wrong and they won’t hesitate to remind you of the truth.”

“I agree.”

“I wouldn’t have talked to him had I known he was a Viscount’s son. Man, the glare he gave me that day. At least my roommate is more… sensible.”

“Sensible, good word.”

Eric chimed in. “Esther, are you having fun?”

“Yes, it’s fun talking with my fellow commoners.”

Phila whispered to Eric: “Why is she acting like that?”

Replying with a smile, he said. “Who knows?”

“Eric, you should be careful, as you can see, he does have quite a temper,” said Lucas.

“Don’t worry, that’s child’s play in comparison to grubby merchants looking to con you for even the shirt on your back.”

“Did you do merchant work?”

“Yeah, struck gold with some plant we found.”

“That’s sounds loads better than what my family does. We are shoe cobblers.” He showed us his palms with calluses likely from continuously swinging a hammer onto nails.

Phila jumped in the conversation. “There’s nothing wrong with being a cobbler! Shoes are an important part of civilized human life!”

“You’re quite enthusiastic about shoes, are you also from a cobbler family?” Said Eric.

“No? My parents run a diner.” He nodded with an unchanged facial expression.

“Esther was it? What about you?”

“My father is a count, but we don’t have a county yet.”

“Right, that’s the same as— wait what?”

So I told him the same thing I told Phila, that I was a newly minted noble.

“Really? No wonder you were so pretty…”

“Wow, Lucas. Are you fancying our Esther?” Eric looked at him.

“I didn’t mean it like that! It’s just I haven’t seen such shiny hair before.”

His blushed cheeks made him look like a kid, although I don’t know if kids can be as tall as him. Sitting half a head taller than Eric, he defended himself from Eric’s barrage of questions. Surprisingly, Phila joined in too, asking why he didn’t compliment her hair.

“Thank you. It’s not often I get to hear compliments.”

“You’re joking right? You’re like one of the most pretty girls I’ve seen!” Phila said.

“Then you must not have seen that many people.” I said.

TK contradiction with dress scene

**Chapter 31: Entrance Ceremony**
=================================

The next day was the entrance ceremony. Phila tossed and turned in her bed the whole night and would at certain intervals ask me whether I was awake or not. She was too excited, she said. I pretended to be asleep after the sixth or seventh time she asked. Real sleep didn’t come to me yesterday.

Sitting shoulder to shoulder with other students, I looked around the dim-lit building that looked like a gymnasium. Rows and rows with chairs were filled with people of all sorts of ages and sizes, they were all attending this event. I wonder how chaotic the cafeteria will be after.

A raised scene was set in front of us where a podium, in the middle, was lit by what could only be described as a spotlight. Having lived in this world for a two years now, I came to the conclusion that these types of magic-devices were just like electronic-devices but wireless. Instead of long cables that went everywhere, the spotlights stood freely on the dark ceiling like floating stars.

The footsteps of a man sauntering towards the podium quieted the low chatter and whispers coming from us, except from Phila that is. Sitting on my right, she whispered excitedly: “Look! That’s the headmaster!”

Gray. His clothes were gray, his hair was gray, and even the beard that reached down to his chest in a pyramidical manner was gray. He must be at least seventy years old.

“I am sixty seven years old,” he said abruptly. His voice carried a great gravitas as it reached our ears, reached the walls behind us, and bounced around the hall with giving it an echo.

“And welcome to this year’s entrance ceremony for the Royal Academy.”

It was a long speech that detailed everything there was to know about the academy. I felt a bit nostalgic as he went through his bullet-points. Established as a way to encourage the growth of intellect to compete with the surrounding nations, it was very successful. All the high-ranking officers and nobles in important positions, such as the prime minister, the royal knight captain, and treasurer were all alumni of the academy.

Lineage mattered little, he said. A noble that can’t use his riches and knowledge effectively is no better than a commoner that knew the hardships of life. Phila nodded enthusiastically as the headmaster repeated other similes and metaphors about commoners and nobles.

“Treat your fellow students as your friends and family, and you will see that the blindfold above your eyes will let the light peek through.” He scanned our faces with satisfaction. "

“And now, let me introduce this year’s top scorer to give another speech.” Another spotlight lit up and followed a girl in uniform walking to the podium. The light bounced off her red twin tails making it look like it was on fire.

“Estelle Nikodemus, congratulations on your results.”

I joined in on the applause as the headmaster gave her an achievement, a rolled up scroll. She curtsied with grace and took over the podium when he stepped back.

Her voice was clear as glass. “Fellow students, I hope you will all take this opportunity to tear yourselves down and shatter into pieces. Hit rock bottom, burst into dust, do whatever you can to make sure the past you, the you from before entering this academy, is dead. I want you to kill yourself.” The hall went silent.

“Only then can the real you be found. All great churches were built with a steadfast foundation. You are all like saplings locked up in a room on a windowsill. It is only after encountering great storms and harsh winds that a tree will form.”

“Grow a thick bark. Bark like a hound and let these next years in your life be that great storm.” She clenched her fist that had been moving with fervor to signal the end.

A single clap was all it took for all of them to break into an applause even louder than the headmaster’s. She stood alone by herself on stage in this cacophony of sounds with poise. Her straight posture was all I needed to see to figure out her upbringing.

“Oh, and don’t actually kill yourself. That was just a figure of speech.” A little golden circle popped up in front of her as laughter, whether fake or not, rose up.

\*\*\*

I sat in the headmaster’s office where he himself served me a cup of tea. It was unfortunately chamomile tea.

“Fascinating, and you came to the answer to this question how?” He was holding my answer sheet.

“Someone I knew explained it to me.”

“And would that someone be willing to have a meeting with me?”

“They don’t exist in this world.” He looked me in my eyes. Light green. They looked refreshing.

“A shame, it’s always the hidden ones that know the most.”

“May I ask why I was called here?”

“How are you finding it having to share a room?”

“It’s fine.”

“Fine enough for a whole year?” I furrowed my eyebrows at him.

“The thing is, your score is lower than it should be because of an oversight, let’s call it a mistake. Adjusting for this mistake, you would be placed in second place. This would make you eligible for a private dorm room.”

“So I can change my room now?”

“Not quite, there are no more available rooms meant for first-years.”

“I see.” I tapped the full cup of chamomile with my finger. “And why are you telling me this, headmaster?”

“Because it’s my responsibility to right the wrongs in this academy.” His aura sharpened as he donned the image of the head of the academy. Taking a closer look, I could see the wrinkles on his face. Deep-set and numerous. It didn’t look like he had an easy life.

TK consider removing last line.

“How would you think of joining the student council? I can give you my personal recommendation.”

  

Leaving his office, I saw Phila stand in the same spot as before I entered. Her feet fidgeted as they pointed inwards.

“What are you still doing here.”

“Did you get expelled?”

I frowned. “Why would I be expelled?”

“O-oh I didn’t mean it like that, it’s just you were called to the headmaster’s office on the first day…”

She followed me when I walked past her. “So what did he say?”

“Nothing special. He just pointed out a mistake.”

“On the test? Speaking of, isn’t it amazing that your cousin is number one?” She gushed about Estelle as if she was her best friend, how pretty she looked, how graceful she moved, and how unique her speech was.

“And that last line she said, she even knows how to be funny. Isn’t she just the perfect role model?”

“I thought you didn’t like nobles.”

Phila thumped her chest. “Yesterday’s me is already dead.”

“That was fast,” I replied.

“But are you sure he only pointed out a mistake? He didn’t ask you to join the student council or something similar?” I whipped my head around.

“Why are you mentioning the student council?” Did she eavesdrop?

“I heard our kingdom’s second prince is the president. Isn’t that amazing?” The eyes behind her glasses sparkled.

I sighed. “Why would the headmaster be inviting me to join? I didn’t even get the highest score.”

She tapped her cheek in thought while walking behind me.

“Where are we going by the way?”

“To class of course.”

“Didn’t we pass by the classroom a while back?” I turned on my heel and went back. No wonder there were no students here in the hallway.

The first class of the semester was about the kingdom’s history. I didn’t like this subject as it was quite hard to fit two world’s worth of history in my brain. But getting second place must have meant I did well enough to remember the important things dates and events.

A room full of eyes stared at us when we opened the classroom door. They were all sitting in neat rows in an oval half circle around the blackboard.

“Late on your first day. I hope this won’t continue the rest of the year, Esther, Phila.” It was Armen, the examiner that made sure that we wouldn’t cheat on our entrance test.

“My apologies, we got lost in the hallways.”

“Right, you two go find a seat.”

The number of students that were accepted each year was about three hundred. Which meant that our batch had to divide up in three groups with a hundred people each; the size of a classroom. There were some familiar faces in this class, Lucas and that blue-haired boy, and Eric who was waving at us to come over. He had two empty seats beside him.

Armen started the lesson with a question.

“Who here knows which year the great war ended and our kingdom got created?” A boy shot up his arm.

“Siegfried, a shame you didn’t get a token, what is your answer?”

“It was the year 0, since that is when our calendar starts.”

“One would think that, but that is incorrect. Although it is called the common calendar, it is more correct to call it the Goddess’ calendar. That was when her body first set foot on our world. Anyone else want to try answering?”

“Year 30, sir.”

“Correct, and what is your name?”

“It’s Eric.”

He whispered to us that he was quite good at remembering numbers, a side effect of being a merchant he added.

The rest of the lesson went well. It was an introduction so most of it was already known to me. Raviel, despite her sometimes nonsensical explanations, was surprisingly a good tutor. Maybe that was why her words sat in my head better than only reading about it. I couldn’t help but compare her style to the more standard and strict way of Armen's. It was for better or worse, drab.

After listening for a total of an hour and a half, a bell rang right after he said his last word. It signaled the end of history class.

A new teacher entered the room. She looked, to say it mildly, boring. Like with her silhouette, I found it hard to focus in her lesson about poetry. And I also found it hard to focus while eating in the cafeteria.

Surrounded by the same people from yesterday: Phila, Eric and Lucas, they chatted amongst themselves as I focused on not letting my spoon drop into the soup.

A day at the academy consisted of four periods of lessons, all in the same classroom with a hour-long lunch break in the middle. It was after this lunch break that I wanted to find someplace quiet to rest. The incessant clacking and grinding of forks and knives on plates, the smacking of people chewing their food, and the loud conversations must have depleted my energy.

I could go back and rest in my room, but it was quite a way to walk to and fro from there back to class. Leaving the others, I took a stroll in the courtyard. I found a quiet corner where a patch of grassy grass was being shaded by a giant tree. Laying down on the soft cool grass and staring at the big leaves filtering the blue sky, it was the perfect spot for a nap. If it weren’t for the two people talking quite loudly behind me.

“I know that you are excited about joining me at the academy, but you shouldn’t seek me out in private like this on academy grounds. What if a scandal breaks out?” A male voice said.

“That’s funny coming from you, so what if a scandal breaks out. Aren’t we set to be betrothed anyway? My fiance.”

He sighed. “That’s what I’m trying to say, aren’t my daily visits for tea good enough for you, Lady Estelle?”

“My name is just Estelle here at the academy. Prince Hylon.”

I pressed my body deeper in the grass.

**Chapter 32: New and old meetings**
====================================

The main reason why I didn’t want to join the student council were because of these two people. My cousin Estelle, and the second Prince of the Guillain Kingdom, Hylon Guillain.

It didn’t take me long to figure out that the boy I saw a year ago that introduced himself with the fake name, Halo, was him. It was quite obvious in hindsight, not many had platinum hair paired with gold eyes after all. I remembered him to be a composed type of person, so hearing his voice have a twinge of impatience was a bit surprising.

“Did you even attend the entrance ceremony.”

“I did.”

“Then what was my speech about.”

“You told told the new students to off themselves.”

I heard someone scoff. “I shouldn’t have said that line if it meant everyone only focusing on that part. I used quite a lot of time and effort writing that speech, did you know that?”

“No I didn’t.”

“Right, because you don’t ask about such trivial things.”

A bell rang, making my already half-open eyes stay the same.

“Look at that, saved by the bell.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“I must take my leave then, Hylon. Class is starting again. Oh, and why don’t you miss this afternoon’s tea? I’m feeling quite tired today.”

Footsteps crumpled on the gravel with an even gait and disappeared towards the academy building. When the only sound left was the murmurs of the wind, a sigh joined to break up the monotony.

“What good is there being a prince?” Said the prince as he too left the courtyard grounds.

And so, it was quiet again. Silent of heavy scoffs and sighs. Silent of what appeared to be a sour atmosphere. Silent enough for me to fall into a slumber. The hearty food and the added benefit of staying up all night silenced any thoughts of walking to class in time.

\*\*\*  
“Did you know that in the olden days, it was quite dangerous for us to spread the words of the Buddha? Frequent beatings and insults were the norm. I heard some were even killed.”

“Why is this tea so bitter?” I would prefer drinking plain hot water over this. There was even a dandelion head in it.

“The established religions and authorities of that time didn’t take it well when the monks went and preached our teachings. One day, a monk by the name Punna, was taking this arduous task into a particularly uncivilized part of the land, and so he went to the Buddha to say goodbye.”

The Buddha said to him, “Those people in that area are very uncivilized. They’re known to be very rough. What will you do if they insult you?”

Punna replied, “If they insult me, I will say to myself, these are very good people in that they’re not hitting me.”

And the Buddha said, “What if they hit you?”

Punna answered, "These are very good people in that they are not stoning me.”

And the Buddha said, “What if they stone you?”

Punna answered, “These are very good people in that they are not stabbing me.”

And the Buddha said, “What if they stab you?”

Punna answered, “These are very good people in that they are not killing me.”

And the Buddha said, “What if they kill you?”

Punna answered, “At least I did not take my own life.”

And the Buddha said, “You are fit to go.”

  

“Now, would you describe Punna as foolish or wise.”

“He’s an idiot, the Buddha should have stopped him if he knew it was dangerous.”

“He should have shouldn’t he?”

“I would have stopped him.”

“Is that right?” He smiled.

“Don’t we have more sugar?”

“Why would you put sugar in broth?”

“What?”

“That’s bitter melon broth, it helps with digestion.” He chugged down his own cup, dandelion head and all.

\*\*\*  
Tk esther skips class. introduce walter (kid named finger)

"Excuse me? Wow, is she really sleeping out here?” A boy spoke.

Yes I am, now go away.

He mumbled further. “Should I wake her up? But the day is almost over, maybe I shouldn’t. Did she skip class on the first day? That’s honestly impressive. This year’s new batch of students sure is something.”

I opened my eyes. “What do you want.”

He let out yelp as he flew up from his bent position, glasses nearly falling off his face. The lenses weren’t as round as Phila’s, although you couldn't really call them sharp either. Something in between.

His tan ponytail laid limp down from his shoulder and contrasted with his otherwise medium-length bangs that parted to the sides across his forehead. His neat tie on his uniform indicated that he was a third-year, the same as the prince.

“My apologies for waking you up, but you haven’t seen the prince around here did you?”

“Why should I tell you, are you going to assassinate him?”

His eyes blew up. “No! I’m his friend!”

“Sorry, that was meant as a joke.” I sat up from the crumpled grass, dusting off the few strands that clung to me. “What time is it?”

“Third period just ended, didn’t you hear the bell?” He took out his pocket watch to show me the time.

It’s silver metal casing adorned with a family crest rustled some of my memories addled by drowsiness. A TK. Which could only mean he was the prime minister’s son. Bending his knees, he stretched out his right hand, palm side up.

“I’m Walter Johnstone, do you need assistance getting up?” He held a gentle smile.

The sunlight filtered through his brown hair as it caressed his face. It was similar to my first meeting with the prince. I guess being loved by the sun was a criterion to be a high-ranking noble.

Grabbing his hand with my left hand, I felt weightless as he lifted me up to my feet. “Thank you, I’m Esther, Esther Nikodemus.”

“Nikodemus?”

“The prince went that way, however it was a while ago so I don’t know if it is all that helpful.”

“That’s great actually! I can’t believe he already skipped a lesson on his first day. Don’t you think the prince himself should set an exemplary image to motivate the other students? Why doesn’t he get that he is a role model for many of them?”

I nodded.

“And then he goes and disappears suddenly, giving me the job of finding him. Why is it my responsibility to find him? I also have things I have to do, you know?”

“Right.”

“Studying, assignments, and my precious free time…” He closed his eyes towards the sky.

“Thank you for waking me up Walter, but I think it’d be best if I went to class now.” I curtsied.

“Ah, I must have taken quite a bit of your time then, my apologies.” And he gave a bow.

For being the prime minister’s son, he was quite scatterbrained. It reminded me of Phila somewhat. I wondered what she would say when I met her again. ‘Esther, you’re late!’, or ‘Where have you been!’, maybe even ‘Oh my gosh, did you skip class on the first day?’.

“It’s alright. Would you know where classroom A Tkcoolname is?”

“Of course, its beside the cafeteria. If you take this left and then another left the door should be right in the middle.” I looked at his erratic hand movements. “Would you like me to lead you there?”

\*\*\*  
"Oh my gosh Esther! You’re late! Did you really skip class on the first day? Where have you been?” Phila said.

I sat down beside her. “I took a nap.”

“I didn’t take you to be that sort of person, Esther,” said Eric.

“Yeah, one would normally think that someone like you would be that type.”

“Phila, what’s that supposed to mean?”

“Oh, sorry! I didn’t mean it like that!”

The fourth and last class for today was theology. I dreaded this moment. It was likely this subject that made me fall down to second place among the new students. Goddesses and churches. I didn’t want to learn about them no more than I wanted to learn about why I came to be in this body. I have accepted it.

A familiar looking man wearing priest robes entered and took the podium. He introduced himself as father Benedictus.

“Have you all witnessed a miracle? You may think that miracles don’t exist anymore, that the Goddess has left us be to do whatever we want. Open up on page three, there you will see the first account of a miracle.”

He read a passage from the book that detailed the holy light from the heavens that ended the great war.

“On that day, night did not come.”

“But father, how can we be so sure that it was a miracle and not some natural phenomenon?” It was the blue-haired boy again.

“Because no natural phenomenon like that light has been documented for the last five centuries.”

Eric whispered: “Hey Esther, isn’t that the priest from our hometown?” Was he? I couldn’t quite remember.

“All miracles have a common point, a proof for being a miracle you could say. Would you know what that is?” He asked the same boy.

“That it’s not been documented before?”

“You’re half right, Siegfried. The correct answer is that they all did something impossible.” I could see him smile standing at the podium. “In fact, I personally witnessed a miracle two years ago, please turn to page seven.”

Scanning the page, my eyes went wide. The details were different but I knew who this page described.

“A girl, that on all accounts should have been dead, no pulse, no breath, opened up her eyes again five minutes after her last breath. It was an awe-inspiring and incredible sight. I had actually been wallowing in doubt before the Goddess helped me open my eyes.”

“Didn’t you just use healing magic?”

“Healing magic is not all powerful as one might think. In fact, this girl was immune to healing magic.”

“So she was a witch?” My eyes twitched.

“Witches are just a fairy tale meant to scare unruly children. This girl was an honest to Goddess human just like us.”

“Hey…”

“Quiet.” I didn’t want to hear whatever Eric wanted to say.

“Now that healing magic is mentioned, would you all like to see it yourselves?”

Excited and noisy chatter filled the room. It was as if they had never seen something so TKcommon before.

“Please give a warm welcome to the second-year student that volunteered to help in this lesson.”

The door opened and a girl with white hair entered. Her new shoes bounced softly across the floor. Her uniform hung onto her with an expertise only found from the best seamstresses. And her eyes were even more blue than before.

“Hello everyone. I’m Lavenza Himmelen. Nice to meet you!”

“Oh my gosh, it’s the saintess!” Phila exclaimed.

The saintess. Duke Himmelen’s daughter.

**Chapter 33: Tea with Lavenza**
================================

“So it really was her the merchants were talking about. Who would have thought that we would coincidentally meet her on the start of her journey, don’t you agree, Esther?”

“Huh? You have met her before?” Phila asked.

“Yeah, in Klippel of all places.”

“What!” She shouted loud enough for the neighboring heads to turn to us.

The priest quieted down the class that had gotten far too noisy from seeing a celebrity in the flesh. He then asked us if anyone wanted to help in a demonstration on how healing magic worked. Not to anyone’s surprise, the majority of the students raised their hand, Eric included.

“Father Benedictus, how about that boy with the red hair?”

“You mean Eric?” Did he really know everyone’s name?

Standing up, he went down the crowd of jealous gazes with his head pointed straight forward. One of them even had a murderous expression on his face. Eric walked up the steps to the podium and appeared to have fun being the center of attention.

“Now, since healing magic is hard to actualize without external wounds, I would like to ask you to draw a bit of blood,” said Lavenza.

She gave him a needle to prick his own finger, but not before raising herself on her toes and whispering something in his ear. He then nodded and gave Phila and I, a thumbs up. Visible from even where we sat, a drop of blood gathered on the tip of his little finger.

“As with all other forms of magic, the first step is to gather the free floating ether and internalize it.” Lavenza then closed her eyes while clasping her hands together.

“The next is to construct the spell.” A glowing circle the size of a hand hovered above Eric’s finger. It looked a bit excessive how bright it was getting.

“And then you pray to the Goddess that it works!” She said with a jovial voice.

As if turning back time, the drop of blood went back into Eric’s finger. It was a bizarre sight, and even more so when gold particles floated around the space where the magic circle had vanished into.

“Wasn’t that quite a sight everyone? How did it feel Eric?”

“It felt warm, like laying in a warm bed kind of warm.”

“What an accurate description. Now, would you call what you just experienced a miracle?”

“Are you trying to say that it is not?”

“That’s right. No one knows when the first instance of magic, and then healing magic were used. However, enough time has passed that we have systemized and experimented countless aspects of it that we can call it a natural phenomenon. Who knows, given enough time, maybe even that miracle where the girl came back from the dead won’t be classified as a miracle anymore?”

The bell rang, but no one seemed to be willing to leave as the students gave him and Lavenza applause. I felt trapped as he smiled at us.

\*\*\*  
In one of the many gazebos spread across the academy courtyard, we were having a little tea party with Lavenza. She had procured some expensive leaves that didn’t taste too bitter. Phila didn’t try the tea, opting instead to let her jaw hang slack. And Eric drank it like it was hot water. It tasted earthy.

“Consider my surprise when I first saw you two sitting on the back rows, how did you end up here? I didn’t expect our next meeting to be at the royal academy.”

“My father inherited my grandmother’s title and became a count.”

“And I got sponsored by a noble that liked my personality.”

“Oh, uh. I passed the entrance test?”

Lavenza put her hand to her mouth and let out a light chuckle. “So that grandfather you mentioned going to visit was the Duke of Nikodemus Duchy? I can’t believe I met someone that important by coincidence.”

“I could say the same to you, Saint Lavenza.”

She sighed. “I don’t even know where and why they began giving me that nickname…”

“Isn’t it because you use your healing ability for free?” Eric said.

“It wasn’t entirely free, I did it for training.”

“The same thing is it not? Phila would agree.”

“Yeah! Lady Saintess, you shouldn’t doubt yourself like that, we call you the saintess because you act like one!”

“Act like one, huh?” She stared into her teacup.

Eric ignored the still air and asked her where Noel was, the black-haired bodyguard that always went with her.

“Didn’t Esther tell you?”

“Tell me what?”

Lavenza looked confused. “Isn’t he your cousin, Esther? Noel Nikodemus graduated last year, so he’s not attending the academy anymore.”

Noel Nikodemus, the first-born son of my uncle. Looking back on the first time I saw him, it was obvious that he was my cousin. Both him and my father had the same hair color, and he acted a bit weird when they greeted each other. I wonder if father also knew who he was or did he forget his nephew’s face.

“He’s your cousin?”

“Why do you look even more shocked than how I was when I first found out.”

“Not that you mention it, you both do have the same aloof air…”

“Ha ha, they do don’t they? I can’t believe I didn’t recognize it the first time.”

We chatted a bit more about small things over tea. Eric told us about this one time he held enough gold coins that even he couldn’t lift and Phila asked Lavenza about whatever came to her mind in that moment. I found it impressive that she answered with a smile to all her silly questions about her favorite foods, color and etcetera.

The four-person tea party ended when the sun nudged in the sky and, Eric and Phila had to take their leave. I felt somehow at ease sitting and sipping lukewarm tea with her. The tea didn’t have enough sugar but it was fragrant enough for me to enjoy.

In the short times I talked to her, I deduced that she liked to smile. And it wasn’t one of those fake smiles that Raviel said all noblewomen should try to learn, it was a genuine smile like one of those my mom had. To be honest, I missed her a bit.

I saw her practically everyday at the estate. We ate together and would have small tea parties with grandmother like this one in the garden few times a week. We didn’t talk about anything special, just how our day was going and about interesting things we had heard from the grapevine. It was mostly to hold the Duchess with company. Although sometimes, mom would have this flash of sadness across her face when certain topics came up in the conversation. The past was one of them.

“Your gloves are pretty.” Lavenza said to me after no words had been exchanged for a while. The liquid in my teacup had gone cold by this point.

“It’s an unique design, did you make it yourself?”

“A seamstress I know heard my idea and made it for me.” I pulled of one of my gloves for her to examine.

“Wow, it’s so stretchy. So that’s why it doesn’t just fall off. Can I try it on?”

I nodded.

Draping her long dainty fingers in through the glove, the dark fabric covered them like paint. It fit them perfectly, showing off the individual joints and bones clearly for me to see. Giving the fabric a tug, she lit it snap against the top of her hand. Her eyes winced while she rubbed the spot. Then she raised her hand.

“How is it? Does it suit me?”

It was weird seeing someone else using these, but it didn’t feel bad. In fact, seeing her satisfied expression with her crinkled eyes and her genuine smile, it felt rather pleasant.

“It’s pretty.”

She giggled. “Thank you, maybe I should commission a pair from your seamstress. Does it have a name?”

“I just call them half-gloves.”

“Such a literal name won’t sell well.”

“I didn’t intend to sell more of them.”

“Really? But they’re so well made.” She appeared to have fun stretching the stretchy fabric. “What about stretch-gloves?”

“That doesn’t sound any better than half-gloves.”

“Hmm, you’re right. Then what about palm-gloves? Since they don’t cover the palm.”

I would rather sit here and discuss more names with Lavenza, but it had gotten quite late by now and there was one thing I wanted to see to before the day ended. And that’s why I went to the headmaster office for the second time today. He served me the same chamomile tea from this morning.

“I want to lodge a complaint.”

“Really now? On the first day?”

“Yes.”

“Would this happen to have something to do with you skipping class today?”

“No, that’s a separate matter. That book father Benedictus uses, I want you to remove a page from it.”

The headmaster ruffled his long beard. “And why should I listen to this demand instead of letting one of our teachers do as he will?”

“Because it contains privileged information about my past.”

“Your past?” He plucked a book from the bookshelf behind him and began to read it.

“Dead on all accounts, dead as the night and dead as the cries from the mother, the little girl was dead. And then, when all hope was lost, and when the mother prayed her last prayer to the Goddess, she opened her eyes again.” He looked at me. “It was a miracle. So this passage of doom and dread is about you?”

“That’s correct, and he didn’t ask neither my parents nor I for permission to use my story.”

“But the girl in the book has brown hair and brown eyes?”

I glared at him. “So what? He even drew my room. Look there’s my plant.” It was probably rotten and dead by now.

He closed the book and waved it in front of my face. “Let me ask, who would know besides you that this passage is a description about you?”

“What are you trying to say?”

“It is difficult to find hope these days. This book by father Benedictus has filled countless people with hope for a brighter future, it is not as simple as removing that single part.”

“Are you joking? My father is a count and the son of Duke Nikodemus.”

“And this girl here is a commoner in some outskirts town.” I grit my teeth.

“How about this. Reconsider my offer of joining the student council and I will see what I can do for you.” He gave me a fake smile.

I couldn’t understand why that old man wanted me to join that stupid student council so much that he even leveraged my past against me. I tried to rationalize and put myself in his shoes. The prince was there, the prime minister’s son was there. Even my cousin that topped the class was there. Weren’t those people enough? Before I knew it, the day had ended and I was back in my dorm, in my bed.

TK extend

“Good night, Esther!” Phila said without an ounce of concern. I stared at her body toss and turn the whole night again.

**Chapter 34:**
===============

TK next day, practical classes.

Sitting in front of the vanity dresser with the mirror, I struggled with tying the ribbon behind my hair. It didn’t want to stay tightened and straight today. Pulling the loops with my hands, one side would get longer than the other, always the right side. And I wasn’t one to walk around with a lopsided ribbon.

“Um… Do you want me to help you?” Phila asked from her bed.

“If you could.”

Practical days were on Tuesday and Thursday, and could be compared to physical education or arts and crafts classes from my previous life. The boys and girls were split, merging the three different classes into two. On the boys side, more physical things were available, the most popular classes being fencing and magic research.

The girl’s had classes in dance, needlework and music. General things a noblewoman needed to learn to mingle in high society. Do consider my disappointment when fencing wasn’t something I could choose.

With our morning routine finished, Phila and I went to the cafeteria to get our breakfast. Eric and Lucas joined us and we got to talking about which practical classes we all chose.

It wasn’t much of a surprise when Eric said that he mentioned he joined the fencing class. The reason? It sounded fun of course. Still, with his physique and the athleticism he showed Karrie and I in the past, it didn’t sound like a bad choice. Who knows, maybe he would even win the annual fencing competition.

TK can extend on fencing

Lucas on the other hand, tall as he was, didn’t look much like an active person sitting there with a slouch.

“I’m going to try out the magic research lesson,” he said.

You may think this class would be some fancy thing where countless lights and sound effects whirled around the room, but learning the introductory basics from Raviel, I could only describe it as boring. Imagine math, where formulas, axioms and theories, but instead of numbers and symbols. It was now only text and symbols.

The fundamental building blocks of magic in this world were words, more importantly words the Goddess herself had given in the form of holy scriptures. Piecing together different phrases and finding the inherent meaning in her words was the essence of magic research.

This meant that even people without the ability to use magic, like Lucas here, would be able to contribute to new techniques and advancements. I didn’t care much for it for that reason, even if magic had sounded interesting in the beginning, reading ‘her’ words made me feel nauseated. Oh, and there were no mention of this golden circle that followed me, as far as I know.

Pushing my inner thoughts aside, I joined the others in giving praise that he would pick such a hard class.

“I picked needlework,” I said when I felt it was my turn to share. I wanted to give mom a nice handkerchief.

“Oh, we’re going to be classmates again then!” Phila said with a bounce.

And so the two of us bounced off to the needlework class after breakfast. We weren’t late this time and entered the room where a single student sat with her arms crossed in the middle of the room, in the middle of the row, and in the middle of the three seats. I didn’t expect her to be here.

Her back was straight as a ruler and her eyes stabbed at us as if we had invaded her little moment of privacy before class started. Thinking about it now, it would be better to arrive late again. Better that than fanning the ire of my cousin, Estelle Nikodemus.

“I see that this year’s class is full to the brim again.” The teacher said with a croaky voice. She was an older woman, perhaps the same age as my grandmother.

Somehow we found ourselves sitting with Estelle. She had moved from the middle seat to the left one, as if ordering us to come sit with her. Estelle on the left, me in the middle, and Phila, who looked liked a raisin with her mouth clenched, on the right. I wondered if she even knew who I was as the only thing she did was listen to the old teacher with a straight face.

“Today, we will start on a simple project. The purpose this time is to make yourselves familiar with the needle and the techniques, meaning that the results won’t matter that much. Ugly or pretty, as long as you learned something, that is good enough. Now, did you all remember to bring your embroidery hoops?”

Setting up the blank handkerchief in the wooden hoop, I pondered what would make my mom happy. It was either desserts or flowers. Estelle finally said something when I picked up my needle with the cake-colored thread.

“Why don’t you remove your gloves first.” She sounded like a porcelain vase.

“Thank you for your concern, but I don’t feel the need to. My hands work fine even with them on.”

“Is that so? Your stiff right hands tells me otherwise. Take your gloves off if you don’t have anything to hide, Esther.” Her sharp eyes, reminiscent of a fox, stared at me. “And why are you using half-finished gloves, it looks hideous.”

“I do have something to hide, Estelle. And I don’t appreciate you calling my gloves hideous. Countless people have complimented this new original design and called it pretty. I for one, agree in their personal assessment.

“Would one of those people be that girl trembling over there?” She pointed her nose at Phila. “Even your company is half-finished.”

I put down the needle in my hand. “What do you want.”

“Nothing much. Just wanted to see this new cousin of mine.” She smiled. “Now, can you two go sit somewhere else?”

\*\*\*  
Looking down at my finished handkerchief of a crepe-cake, I felt proud of myself. It was quite hard to embroider each of the sixteen individual layers of crepe and cream. I even had to needle with my left hand after my other hand didn’t want to move the way I wanted it to. But as they say, hard work pays off in the end.

“Esther…” Phila was holding hers in her hand. It was a bluebell, I think. The stencil she used looked nothing alike the thing she embroidered on her handkerchief. Still, it had her personality with the way the lines bounced everywhere.

“Esther!” She whispered loudly.

“What is it Phila.”

“Shouldn’t we have, you know… Moved?”

“She only asked if we could, it wasn’t an order now was it?”

“That’s right.” Estelle held up her finished handkerchief to the light. It was platinum-blonde rose with a red stem in the shade of her hair.

“Your cake looks tasty. And Phila was it? You should try to relax your shoulders when you hold the needle. It helps with maintaining your straight lines.”

“And try to follow the stencil if you have one, what use is it if you freehand either way,” I added. Phila looked a bit dumb as Estelle and I gave her advice.

My grandmother had given me a heads up regarding Estelle’s prickly nature and barbed comments, so it didn’t bother me that much. But someone that didn’t know and only knew her from afar would most likely act like Phila in this situation. Although her comment about my hand did surprisingly made me feel irritated.

“When will you come to visit?” We stood in the hallway after class ended.

“I’m not certain.”

“I see. I look forward to it.” Then she left us, dragging most of the other female students with her.

The crowd that formed made her look like a celebrity as she answered offhandedly their comments about this and that.

Phila spoke up when they rounded the corner. “She isn’t like how I imagined her to be at all…”

“You shouldn’t judge a book by its cover.”

“What’s that supposed to mean? All book covers look the same?”

“Right, I forgot.”

Finding ourselves finished for today, we ventured to where the boys and Eric were still training.

Exerting themselves in this weather while in their uniform would mean suicide. Which is why all the boys wore more casual clothes that flowed on their body. Loose shirts and pants that wouldn’t rip even if one of the boys did the split.

The boys were grouped in pairs and sparred against each other. One side would thrust towards the abdomen and the other side would counter with a riposte, smacking the needle-sword out of the way and countering with a thrust of their own.

We sat and looked at the group being led by our history teacher, Armen, on the tribunes that were shaded by a roof.

Fencing class was led by our history teacher, Armen. He looked like the commander back in the duchy with the way he poked and prodded at the boys that either didn’t hold the sword correctly or had their feet tangled and would most likely fall over if even a light wind hit them.

We sat in the shaded tribune seats and listened to the soft metal clangs that rang satisfyingly in the air.

“Look, there’s Eric— Wow…” Phila pointed to where she found Eric and his partner.

The two of them looked to be doing this exercise a bit more intensely than the others. Sweat had gathered on their shirts and flicking of their chin on each riposte, was a handful of drops. His partner was the blue-haired boy.

“Siegfried, I really need a break soon.”

“Are you mocking me? You still look composed as ever!”

“Whoah there.” Using the lower part of his blade, Eric swathed away the tip of Siegfried’s sword with ease, It didn’t look like this was his first time fencing at all with the way he naturally leveraged the balance point of the two blades.

“I know that these are just practice swords, but it still can hurt you know? Lets calm down a little?” Siegfried struggled with his own riposte, barely managing to shove the other sword away.

“You are mocking me!” Ah, he had thrust at Eric’s throat, where nothing but skin would meet the sword. Blunt tip or not, with enough force, even an unsharpened pencil would be able to penetrate through his esophagus.

“Watch out!” Phila yelled in the hopes that it would reach him fast enough.

It grinded. Eric had managed to trap Siegfried’s blade from the outside before moving it a circular fashion towards the inside, all the while grinding the attacking sword. And with a flick of his wrist, Siegfried’s lost control of his weapon as it flew gracefully through the air. Eric had done a perfect circular parry.

Pushing his soaked hair away from his forehead, he said: “Calm down man, are you trying to kill me?”

Armen went over to the boys and gave them a scolding. Siegfried had to stay back and do extra training and Eric got a literal slap on the wrists. He rubbed them as we went to the cafeteria.

“Eric, you were so cool!” Phila pumped both of her fists.

“Haha, thank you.”

“I can’t believe he would do something so dangerous, and someone like him is a noble?”

“He isn’t a bad person, I think. It’s just the youthfulness talking.”

“Aren’t you two the same age,” I said.

“Are we? I wouldn’t know.”

We were about to enter when someone stomped behind us.

“Hey you!”

“You already lost, go away!” Phila yelled at him.

And ignoring her, he grabbed something from the inner pocket of his uniform. Smack! A white glove plastered across Eric’s chest and fell pathetically to the floor.

“I challenge you to a duel! In one month!"

Eric narrowed his eyes and smiled as the crowd forming around us murmured quite loudly. I understood their excitement, a duel between two students were quite rare, and more so when it hadn’t even been a week into the new semester yet.

**Chapter 35:**
===============

“Hey, did you hear? Some of the first-years students have already challenged each other to a duel.”

“What? Why? Shouldn’t they be focusing on their studies? All that hard work to attend this academy and they are only thinking of fooling around? My parents would be ashamed if that happened to me.”

“With your grades, it’s a wonder how they aren’t ashamed yet.”

“What did you say?”

The two boys were talking on their way back from the last class of the day. And in the hallway they walked through, was the student council room more akin to an office than a classroom, where the second prince of the Guillain Kingdom, Hylon Gullain was currently perusing some documents in his hand.

All sorts of things were sent to the student council. But the most important, and frankly the only thing that mattered, were the submissions and questions the students had. It was their job after all to act as a middleman between the students and the Royal Academy. It was like a simplified version of running the kingdom, the king had said to Hylon.

“Walter, what is this?” He looked at the document that had come first thing in the morning.

“That’s the request submitted by a first-year student, your Highness.”

“Really? So my eyes aren’t playing tricks on me. Do we have any information on this Siegfried and Eric?” The day had just started and Hylon didn’t feel the need to already wreck his brain for something his aide could find out himself. Walter looked through his journal that was always with him, the same with his pocket watch.

“The former is the newly appointed Viscount’s son and the latter is a commoner that won himself a sponsorship from a Marquess in the west.”

The West, the agricultural center of the kingdom where three-fourths of all crops were swaying softly in the fertile ground. Hylon had been there once and liked the place, much better than this cramped room filled with papers and ink.

“When was the last duel on academy grounds?”

“Two years ago, it was between Lord Gilbert’s son and a commoner.”

“Right, I remember that. Poor sap didn’t stand a chance against Noel. How many duels have resulted in a casualty?”

“None, your Highness. We don’t allow sharp weapons here.”

“Then it would be no problem if I signed right here would it?”

Walter furrowed his brows at the prince standing up. “Your Highness?”

“Actually why don’t you do it? You have learnt my signature have you not?” Hylon walked past his aide. “In fact, why don’t you sign all of those documents?” Putting his hand on the door handle, Walter grabbed his arm wanting to open it quite firmly.

“Your Highness.” His glasses looked quite sharp. “You can’t keep avoiding your fiance by running away. If you two have had a fight then the logical action is to make up.”

Hylon was surprised when Estelle said she wanted to join the student council, and even more surprised when that stuck up old man accepted her request. All these years at the academy and not one soul had gotten through his needle eyes. Meaning that for half a day, everyday, at the royal academy, he would share this room with this aide reading and writing documents. Walter was quite excited when he heard that a new member would be joining.

“Why do I feel like you only say that for the student council’s benefit and not mine? And did you get stronger? You’re crumpling my sleeve.” He smiled.

“You must be imagining things, your Highness. I have started doing a little exercise and a little ironing will straighten your blazer no problem.” And Walter smiled back.

“Let go of me for Goddess’ sake!”

“I can’t sign off all these documents by my own, your Highness!”

Hylon pushed Walter’s face who glomped at him, making sure he would not escape from this place. Even though his aide looked more like the scholarly type with his glasses, he was quite good at chaining down people. Especially if that person was the second prince of the Gullain Kingdom.

“What are you two doing.”

“Estelle! Please help me, he is trying to escape!”

Estelle looked at the two boys tangled together that greeted her the moment she opened the door. And with a look full of disgust and scorn, said: “No thanks.” She walked past them and sat on a free chair. There were quite a few free chairs in the room, yet she chose the one that was the furthest away from them.

Finally being freed from his aide, Hylon straightened his clothes and trudged to Estelle.

“How have you been?”

“Good.”

This was the first time in a while he had talked to her. Ever since she suggested he skip their tea meetings, he’d avoided her altogether, going as far to give Walter his personal seal to stamp the towering documents.

“How were the lessons?”

“Hylon, why don’t you do some work. Here, these require your own personal eyes.” She gave him a paper with some ink on it.

Looking at his fiance from his seat, he wondered if all the Nikodemus children had the same temperament. First it was Noel Nikodemus, who was stiff as a statue and rarely showed an emotion other than straight eyebrows and straight mouths. Then it was Estelle Nikodemus who looked like she never smiled before. At last, it was Esther Nikodemus, the girl he had encountered at the duchy who was like her cousins combined. Uninterested eyes and a blank face. Although he remembered seeing her smile once.

“Have you met your cousin?”

“I have. She seemed to be doing well enough, even had a friend.”

“Really? I can’t imagine her doing well with her peers.”

Estelle stopped scribbling. “What do you mean by that?”

“The first time I met her, she was poking at some frogs—”

“The first time?” She stared him in the eyes. “And when was this first time that I haven’t heard about?”

“Last summer? Why is that relevant?”

“I see.” Estelle packed up her stationery into her bag and stood up. “I’m feeling quite tired suddenly. Let’s meet again tomorrow.” And so, having worked through a quarter of the stack of documents, Estelle left the student council room where Walter found it difficult to keep his jaw shut.

“Your Highness… You didn’t tell her?”

“Tell her what?”

“That you already met her cousin!”

“Why is that important?”

“Of course it’s important, why are you so idiotic in this matter?”

Hylon looked at the closed door while Walter suffered from something in the background. Even with his self-proclaimed expertise in reading people. He could never understand what made his fiance tick. She would often say that she was tired, but whether that was the truth or not, he didn’t want to know. It was interesting at first, like a new jig-saw puzzle that didn’t have a guide to follow, he tried to fit what piece went where. Yet after all the conversations and tea meetings and reading her body language. He would constantly find that there were missing pieces, or that some pieces didn’t fit.

It wasn’t interesting at all.

\*\*\*  
Another morning arrived on this weekend.

A week passed and another morning had arrived on the weekend.

No classes were set for these two days, giving the students some time to do whatever they wanted, be it go into the capital or study up on their material. Me? I just wanted to get some more sleep, although the sun piercing through my eyelids had another intention. The white curtains seemed to only make the room brighter.

“Where are you going?” I asked Phila while laying in bed. It was already past breakfast and she had just entered the room to retrieve some things from her drawer full of things she had collected in the past few days. Mine was empty in comparison to hers with nothing but the briefcase small enough to have all my things in it. Hearing my voice, she did a little start.

“You’re still here Esther? Didn’t you eat?”

“I didn’t feel like it.” I had intended to sleep in after all.

“I’m going to out to explore the capital with my other friends, do you want to come?”

Other friends. Well, she did appear to get a new friend every day. I did sometimes see her eating with them at breakfast, lunch and dinner, but thought no more of it until yesterday. It was the first time in a while that I ate alone.

Eric was busy with his new-found fame and training, and eating alone with Lucas… Well, let’s just say we didn’t have anything in common to talk about. I could eat with Lavenza, but it didn’t feel worth the energy to waddle through her fans. Maybe I could sit with Estelle next time. What good is family if not to be there when you needed them? I sighed.

“Maybe next time.”

“See you later then!” She looked quite happy bouncing out of the room.

“What should I do today then?”

It was no problem finding something to do back at the estate. Testing new desserts made by the chef, talking with the Duchess or mom, and fooling around with the maids and Melissa. I wonder how she was doing working in the capital residence where my uncle lived. She would temporarily work there until my parents found a place to settle down in to.

Sitting on some bench in the courtyard. I checked the scheduler I brought with me with my briefcase. Four months until semester break and three weeks until Eric’s duel. Karrie would probably find this situation amusing. Maybe I should write her a letter.

Taking out a piece of paper, the blank page in my hands did little to spurn my creativity. White like the clouds above, it felt almost wasteful to stain it with ink. So I didn’t. In a daze, I ended up sitting and staring at the blankness for who knows how long. Under the sun that warmed up my rather cold body.

“Are you having trouble finding the right words?”

“Huh?” I said stupidly.

“You’re thinking of writing a letter right?”

“It’s you again, Walter. Good morning.”

He showed me his pocket watch again. “I’m sorry to say this, but it’s already past noon.”

“Is that so? I didn’t notice.”

“May I ask to whom you are writing to?”

“It’s to my friend, she and I live quite far from each other now.”

“Maybe that’s why time seemed to pass so quickly.” He gestured with his hand if he could sit beside me. I didn’t see a reason to refuse him.

“Did you know that this is my favorite spot in the whole academy?” His eyes softened below his glasses. “Those trees over there had a nest of birds last year, and everyday like clockwork, the baby birds would call for their mother to feed them. Caw, caw, they would sing. Until she came back with that day’s feed. Impressive don’t you think? To be able to feed all those children by herself.”

“It certainly is.” I thought back on my previous mother. “And then what happened?”

“They grew up and left the nest of course. As does all children in due time.”

“Sounds pleasant.” He let out a chuckle.

“What’s funny?”

“I didn’t think you would be this interested in my story.”

“It was nice to listen to.”

“Should I tell you another one then?”

He told me several other stories that happened in this spot. Most of them were mundane things, like how that broken branch was the result of someone tripping, or how he had planted that sapling over there by himself. Mundane as they were, it was better hearing him speak than listening to the buzz of the background.

“Pardon me, but can I ask you to turn around? Something has been bothering me for a while.” I felt his hands graze my hair before giving it a little tug. “There, now it’s neat and pretty.” He straightened the ribbon I had struggled with.

“Thank you. I can’t seem to do it right by myself.”

“It does take some time to get used to doesn’t it? Not having a maid to help you out.”

I nodded.

“Do you see those flowers? My maid gave me them as a parting gift. I don’t quite remember their meaning but I was happy nonetheless.”

“…”

“Which is your favorite flower?”

“I don’t hold flowers in a positive light.”

He creased his eyes. “Really? I think purple Alliums would suit your eyes.”

Unity and patience. I did feel patient these days, although how long that would last this time, I did not know. Nor would I like to know. Seeing the field of Allium in front of me, I could only wait.

  

**Chapter 36: sunday**
======================

Saturday passed somehow, and then it was Sunday. Did I mention that there was church built on academy grounds? And did I mention that it was a requirement to attend mass there each Sunday morning? It must have slipped my mind.

“How is it possible for someone to rise back from the dead?” I heard someone say with a voice not low enough to be called a whisper.

“That’s why people think it must have been the work of a witch.”

“But father Benedictus said himself that she was a normal person?”

“Think, man. What good would it be if he affirmed that it really was a witch. It would surely sow chaos.”

“What a scary thought…”

There it was again. Someone calling me a witch. There were countless other examples of miracles in his stupid book, so I don’t understand why my example was the most popular talking-point. What even was a witch? I stared at the Goddess. In my eyes, she was the one that looked the most like a witch.

“Isn’t she pretty?” Phila said beside me.

“It’s a statue.”

“No, I meant the Saintess. I can’t believe you two are friends with her.”

“Didn’t you meet with her last time?”

“Yes, but it’s not like I can call myself her friend, right? I mean, I’m just some girl…”

“We can go talk to her again if you are so unsure.”

“Really?” Her glasses sparkled.

Morning mass was a quick thing. A priest from the capital held it and finished by giving all of us a blessing. It bounced off my body this time too.

Exiting the opulent gray building, I made way to the headmaster’s office with Phila in tow. There was something to discuss before meeting with Lavenza.

“I see you brought a companion today.” The headmaster said seeing her stand beside my chair.

“Why am I here?”

“You will be my witness for this discussion.” She let out a meek “why?”.

“And pray tell, what is it that we will discuss?”

“Remove my part from this.” I slammed the book on his desk.

“Ah yes, ‘The book of Miracles’. It has been pretty popular these days haven’t it?”

“I’m tired of being called a witch. It’s slander against my name and image.”

“As I previously said, there is not much I can do—”

“I will join your student council.”

He rubbed his beard. “Is this matter that important to you? Even your friend didn’t know who the book was talking about before you so succinctly spelled it out.” Phila must have had a shocked expression beside me.

“My parents and old acquaintances knows, and that is reason enough for me. Ask him to remove it. Please.” I bowed my head.

“It won’t be easy, but I will see what I can do.”

“Thank you. Then I will take my leave.”

“Don’t forget your friend. She looks like she witnessed a ghost.” He hummed with a smile.

“Old man, I’m coming in.”

Darn. I failed to avoid him today.

“Hylon, what did I say about knocking, and I have guests at the moment.”

“You, guests? Oh, it was true.”

The second prince stood in the doorframe with a stack of papers in his hand.

\*\*\*

"So you’re going to join the student council?” Us students had moved out of the headmaster’s office.

“That’s right, your Highness.”

“What’s with the formality, just act like how you were when we first met.”

“I believe this is my first time meeting with the second Prince.”

“Is that right?”

“Yes it is.” I met with some boy named Halo after all.

“And you didn’t purposefully avoid me until now, right?”

Hmm, he was quick on the uptake. I would like to deny his statement if I could.

“You must be Phila from Klippel. Nice to meet you.” He flashed a smile.

“L-likewise, your Highness.”

“Let’s have a pleasant conversation some other time, I found myself with something rather bothersome today.”

“I wish you luck, your Highness.”

“A year sure does change a person,” he commented, before opening the door to the headmaster’s office.

Phila spoke up after we had walked a bit down the hallway. “Esther… Are you sure you were a commoner just a year ago?”

“What do you mean?”

“It seems like all important people already knew who you were…”

“It’s a coincidence. You can ask Eric if you want.”

Going down the stairwell, a group of chatty girls stood at the bottom.

“Phila! Let’s go play in the capital! I heard a new shop just opened!”

“Oh really? Give me a minute!”

“Didn’t you want to meet with Lavenza?”

“I’m sorry Esther, but I think my heart has had enough excitement for today…”

\*\*\*  
“Haha, you really said that to the prince?”

“He didn’t introduce himself as the Prince and I hadn’t seen his portrait before.”

She mimicked my voice. “Excuse me, you are blocking the sun.” She laughed. “I can only imagine what he looked like when you said that!” Lavenza found my first encounter with Hylon so funny that she even grasped her own stomach.

I was currently in her room having some tea and cake. It was a mini tea party. She had invited me when all the usual gazebos were occupied by all the students having free time. Some were chatting over tea, while others were drowning their noses in their books.

Since she did quite well at the academy, she had her own room, with one single bed for one person, and one single drawer to put her things. It didn’t bother me at all.

“I think you are laughing a bit too much, Lavenza.”

“You’re kind of rude.” She mimicked my voice again. “Fine, fine, I will stop. Please don’t glare at me.”

She gave me another slice of cake.

“So you will be joining the student council? I heard it’s a pretty hectic position. Don’t you also need quite a high grade to apply?”

“That won’t be a problem. I struck a deal with the headmaster.”

“What? A deal?”

“Oh, and I actually placed second among the first-years. They did a mistake in the results.”

“What?! Second?!”

I explained what had happened and she nodded quite lively at my words.

“Which subject did you get wrong marks on?”

“Theology.”

“Oh.” She turned her eyes to my hand. “How is it now?”

I gave it a little flex. “It’s still stiff and gets in the way of more tasks than I would like. Other than that, it doesn’t bother me that much anymore.”

“That’s good to hear.” She smiled.

There was a lull in the conversation as we sat and sipped our tea in silence. It wasn’t an awkward silence that felt oppressive however. It was silence that actually felt comforting. Maybe it was because she was one of the few people that had seen it; I didn’t trust Phila enough to show her again and I didn’t want to bother Eric with trivial things.

“You know,” she said when the moment felt right, “I learnt something on my journey after our encounter in Klippel. There’s a technique that knights use that stimulates blood flow to help with soreness and muscle pain. Have you heard of it?”

“I can’t say I do.”

“May I?” She asked for my hand.

With her own fingers, she slowly stripped away my glove, revealing bit by bit the disgusting pink flesh that hid underneath. I felt a twinge of sadness when I compared my bare imitation-fingers against her normal and pretty fingers. My knuckles looked like sharp jagged cliffs while hers were like soft snow dunes that had just formed from the sky.

Lavenza put my glove on the table and studied my hand by flipping it over a few times. Then she began caressing my scars as she rubbed my hand with her thumbs. Their touch was soft and cool, it felt nice on my skin in this warm room.

“I will start now, is that all right?”

“Isn’t this just a normal massage— Ah!” I clasped my hand across my mouth as an unwanted moan escaped.

“Sorry, did I do it too hard?”

“N-no it was just unexpected.” It felt really good.

“Are you sure? I can stop if you want, I’m not sure I’m even doing it correctly.”

“I think you are, please continue…”

What was this? I’ve never felt this pleasant feeling before. Each time she pressed her thumb further and deeper into my flesh, the better it felt. Like a dried layer of mud a the bottom of a sun-baked lake that flaked off, my mind felt lighter each time she massaged it, scraping away my thoughts with her hands. I ended up having to bite my lips as I couldn’t control my voice.

“Mhm.”

“Please bear with it Esther, I’m soon finished.” Her thumbs rolled down to the joint between my index and middle finger. “If I press here—”

“Wait, Lavenza!”

The last thing I heard was a snap coming from my hand.

\*\*\*  
Lavenza felt a bit confused. When the female-knight showed her this technique, she didn’t react the same was as Esther did. Sure it felt pleasant, but not that pleasant… Maybe it was because she didn’t use it much? Esther’s hand did feel quite rigid in her hands when she gave her a massage.

“Esther, are you sleeping?” Like a marionette with her strings cut, she had slumped into the chair after she untangled a stubborn knot below her knuckle. Her hand looked a bit smoother now, although with a deeper pink hue. Lavenza had rubbed quite fervently spurned on by her voice.

She believed it was a good thing that she had fallen asleep. It shocked her how haggard she looked when she met her today. How many sleepless nights were she having to look like that?

Lavenza looked at the book on her shelf. The book that father Benedictus had written and published. She would normally tune out gossips and the like, but a certain comment about a witch had piqued her interest. It sounded eerily similar to the story that boy, Eric, had told her.

“How can someone find themselves calling her a witch? She looks more like a cat too me.” Albeit a grumpy cat. She let out a chuckle from the image that formed in her thoughts.

Taking a pillow from her bed, Lavenza propped up the girl’s head in a more comfortable position and draped a light blanket over her skirt. With no one to talk to anymore, she started to study for next week’s lessons. All the while the exhausted girl’s soft breathing filled the background.

  

**Chapter 37: student council idk TK Extend**
=============================================

“So all I need to do is read over these documents and sign them off?”

“That’s correct, it’s not that hard is it?”

Walter was showing me the ropes on how work was being done in the student council, explaining every little detail that I didn’t understand. It reminded me a bit on how Eric would explain the intricate details on wares that one time in Klippel a year ago. The difference being that Walter felt more passionate and excited than him. Very excited when he saw me come through their door.

“Is it really necessary to prepare all these things for only a duel?” I stared at the bullet points that started from the top of the page and all the way down to the bottom, not even leaving a margin.

“Don’t forget the backside, Esther,” said Estelle without lifting her head.

Her red twintails bounced softly each time she stacked a signed document in a neat tower. Bounce, bounce. She was quite fast at this.

Seeing my own pile of documents that laid haphazardly in a not so neat pile, I started to regret deciding to accept the headmaster’s deal. This was entirely different from how the student council was in my previous life, where the hardest thing was to mediate arguments between students and and calm down angry clubs that got their budget cut.

I looked at the desks that was more paper than surface. “When do we finish with all these?”

Walter laughed happily. “We don’t.” He dragged a chair to sit across from me. “When the hour hand crosses eight, that is when we can escape from here.”

“Right. Shouldn’t the prince help us out? Where is he?”

“Who knows.” Said Estelle without lifting her head.

“Oh, he had some business to do outside the academy today, so he won’t be coming in today unfortunately.”

“Unfortunate indeed. But what can the prince do when his people calls for him?” She lifted her head this time. “His time is the country’s time after all.”

“Uhm, Estelle? You shouldn’t grip the pen that hard, and maybe he will visit at the end of the day?”

The three of us continued to do our work and Walter stopped double-checking my signed-off papers after the result satisfied him. It was remarkably silent after that. After taking his own seat at his desk, the soft aura that surrounded him took a sharp turn as he looked to be in his element.

I thought that Estelle was fast, yet he was even faster, finishing two when she did one. I even saw him read two documents at once a few times. And here I thought he was just someone that liked to talk. Being the prime minister’s son must be no joke.

Scribbles and clinking of square ink bottles filled the room until it was time to finish up. Despite Walter’s comment, prince Hylon did not show up even when we worked ten minutes extra. And so we went to the cafeteria to get dinner.

Today’s dish was fish with a side of assorted steamed vegetables, mushrooms being one of them. Walter said that it was most likely caught from the sea on the east and transported here via carriages filled with ice made from magic. Putting a piece of the filet in my mouth, it tasted like normal fish. Fishy.

“So what’s your favorite food?” Walter asked us, who sat on the other side of the table.

“Mine are desserts,” I said.

“That’s… surprising.”

Estelle put a whole mushroom into her mouth. “I don’t care much for the taste, as long as it’s filling then that’s fine by me.”

“That’s also surprising. What about bitter things?”

“I read that bitter food is good for your health.”

I ate while listening to them discuss the health benefits of bitter food. Is that why medicine is so bitter? The dozen or so pills and tablets I took per week wouldn’t be so hard to swallow if some sugar was mixed in with it.

“It’s the student council in the flesh. May I sit here?” Wow, he actually asked this time.

“You must be Eric? Go ahead.” Walter gestured to the seat beside him, opposite of where I sat.

“You’re going to have to pay for the food if you eat that much every time, Eric.” There was a tall lump of food on his plate.

“What can I do? Training this much makes me constantly hungry.”

“You must be the duelist the students are talking so much about,” Estelle said.

“Is that what they call me now? Last week it was swordmaster. It’s nice to finally meet you, Esther’s cousin.”

“That’s not my title.” She ate another mushroom.

Walter turned to Eric and I. “Do you two know each other?”

“You could say I’m her childhood friend, right?”

“Karrie is my childhood friend.”

He smirked. “Ouch.”

“Is that right? I didn’t know that.” Hmm? Did Walter just lie?

“She doesn’t talk much about us does she? Must be because she’s secretly embarrassed that I’m her friend or something.” He turned to Walter.

“Stop being silly, Eric.”

“It’s my personality. Are you going to eat those mushrooms?”

“No, go ahead.” How big was his stomach to hold all this food? Growing boys sure were different.

Apart from the appearance of one golden circle, the conversation we had was pleasant enough. Although it was mostly Eric and Walter that talked. Estelle didn’t say much, and I felt too lethargic to join their double monologue about this and that.

TK maybe extend with a scene with eric or smt, gotta hit that word count.

Parting with them, I made my way back to the dormitory where Phila had already fallen asleep. But instead of stopping here for the day after changing into my nightgown, I made my way back out again to where the stairwell was. I scaled the stairs up one more floor to where the second-years resided. I really looked forward to having a good night’s sleep today.

“I’m sorry Esther… But maybe you should sleep somewhere else tonight?”

Hearing Lavenza’s words almost made me drop the pillow I had brought with me. Her figure peeking halfway out of the hall and halfway into her room were lit up by the lamp hanging on the wall. Her expression was unlike anything she had worn, and I knew that the best option was to go on my merry way, and not disturb her. But I couldn’t stop myself.

“What? Why?”

“It’s something that I can’t share with you.” Her voice was almost crying.

“What’s wrong?”

“Please Esther? Just for today?”

Standing in front of her reluctantly open door, I saw a white letter on her oak-colored desk over her shoulder, before she stepped forward to block my vision.

“Are you all right?”

She smiled instead of answering. It wasn’t pleasant. I heard a sniffle right before she closed the door on me.

It was cold out here in the hallway. The sun had long ago vanished below the horizon and left the sky for the moon to play in. Stars filled the view outside the window like white ink on a pitch-black blank piece of paper. The blinding dots rooted me in place, the only thing I could do was hug the pillow in my arms.

I went back to my room after who knows how long. Phila was snoring as always in her bed, in her side of the room, with that drawer overflowing with things. Digging my ears into the pillow, I attempted to sleep.

I didn’t knock on Lavenza’s door after today, and neither did she invite me over again. We would chat like usual outside in the courtyard and in the hallways when we met each other. As if nothing had happened. But I could see the same flashes of sadness in her eyes that my mom would sometimes have.

What was in that letter?

And so month passed since I arrived at the royal academy and it was finally time for Eric’s duel against Siegfried.

**Chapter 38: Twenty-four degrees**
===================================

“Are you all right, Esther?” Phila’s hands were grabbing my ribbon. “You have really deep eye bags…”

“A little more powder will fix it.”

“If you say so…”

Then someone knocked on the door and cracked it open.

“Phila? Are you coming?”

It was her other friends that she seemed to be spending more and more time with. They would probably have breakfast in the capital again as it was another Saturday.

“You guys, don’t come in without asking first!” She seemed happy chasing them out. “I’m sorry about that, Esther. See you this afternoon?”

I stared at my hair ribbon in the mirror. It was purple and funnily, crooked.

I think breakfast was good today. It was either some protein with carbohydrates, or it was carbohydrates with some vegetables. Either way, it went into my mouth and down my stomach. I ate alone today since I had woken up quite late.

“Hylon, did you ask that second-year to assist us in case something would happen?”

“You don’t have to worry about that, she was the first to volunteer after all.”

“The saintess, huh? I can see why the other students are calling her that. Don’t you think so?”

The three of them were talking about something.

“Esther? Are you all right?” Walter appeared in front of me.

“Sorry, what did you say?”

“We were talking about Duke Himmelen’s daughter. Aren’t you two quite close with each other?”

“Close?” You could say that. Why, we even had a tea party before this.

“Is it not to your liking Esther?” There was a pudding on my plate. Someone had taken a spoonful out of it as one of the corners were missing.

“It’s sweet.”

“Isn’t it? A new patisserie just opened and I really wanted to try it.” Judging from her voice, I think she smiled, but all my focus was on the soft feeling that spread across my tongue. It was much too soft. And too sweet. I don’t think this new patisserie will be open for long.

Oh, and I also cheered for Eric today.

\*\*\*  
Eric felt good today. And even if he didn’t, he had to. Maybe it was better to forfeit this duel, nothing good would come from angering a noble after all. He had seen many things while in his merchant apprenticeship. Going to small towns to big cities, a constant sight of poor people that lived from hand to mouth greeted him. And talking to them revealed how the majority of them ended up like that.

If you were to commit to doing a task, then you better do it well. His father’s voice echoed in his head.

“Hah, I must be really nervous to think about these things.” All he needed to do was the same as he always did. Be confident, and smile. Smile to the world, and it will smile back.

“Eric, I know these are blunt, but still be careful all right?” Lucas handed him the fencing-sword.

“Relax man, it’s not like one of us will die or anything. Look, even the saintess is here with us today.”

White hair and blue eyes, what a coincidence that they met her a year ago. And now he was even attending the royal academy with her and Esther. What a funny turn of events.

Stepping out of the tent where he had been waiting, the blazing sun above flashed him a big grin. Today was a good day indeed.

Even when it was the weekend on a Saturday, nearly all the first-years had gathered together at the training grounds. It made sense as it was a rare event that even had the backing of the famous student council.

Eric let out a whistle as he glanced at all the excited faces that sat on the tribunes. Narrowing his eyes a little, he saw Phila and Esther sit together a little bit further away. Phila was fidgeting more than usual and Esther sat aloof as always.

The tribune was set around a wooden platform that was raised a foot off the ground. The long strip of walkway would act as today’s arena where he would face off Siegfried. A white line the width of a door was drawn in the middle. And on both sides, three steps away another line was drawn. This was the starting line where the two fencer’s would start.

Tk extend

  

“Eric, don’t you think Esther is acting a bit weird today?”

“Weird how so?”

“She doesn’t talk as much and doesn’t pay much attention on our conversations.”

“Isn’t that normal?” That was just an accurate description of her personality.

“Really? She didn’t even finish the pudding I brought… I really thought she would like it.”

“What did you say?”

“That she would like it?”

“Not that. She didn't finish her dessert?”

“No… She said it was too sweet.”

Ridiculous. That girl thought something was too sweet? He saw once how many spoons of sugar she had poured into her cup of tea. She could be eating plain sugar and still wouldn’t complain. Actually, now that she mentioned it, where was she? As if the Goddess had planned it, Phila entered the tent.

“Congratulations Eric! You were really impressive!” Her eyes behind her glasses appeared to be genuinely happy for him. “I couldn’t believe it when you did this! And then that!” She imitated with her hands what he had done.

TK extend

  

“Thank you Phila. Don’t tell me you thought I would lose?”

“Of course not!” She pumped her fists. “Even if you did, I would go over and beat him up for you!”

Eric laughed. “Who would beat who now?”

“I think I understand why Esther acts that way now…”

“Speaking of her? Where is she?” Lavenza asked.

“What do mean? She’s right here— Huh?”

Eric felt a terrible feeling run down his back. Seeing him remove his armor in a hurry, Lavenza sensed that something was wrong.

“What is it?”

“I apologize, but can you two help me find her?”

\*\*\*

Hylon looked at his fiance that had called him over the moment the duel finished. She was brewing a pot of tea with a practiced hand, as always. Taking a sip without making a sound, he had to grimace in his mind that drinking a hot liquid on a hot day like this made little sense.

Luckily, they sat in a private gazebo that hadn’t seen use for nearly a month. The alabaster paint bounced the midday sun from the table surface and onto her face. He had to agree that she was pleasant to look at.

Her hair dominated the room whenever she occupied it, reflecting a light-red shade around the surroundings. And a confession he would never tell Walter, he did like her twintails. It was cute. Although it didn’t really suit her. Sharp as a fox and serious as a statue, she held the cup to her lips.

He put down his cup and waited for her to do the same, yet all she did was blow gently on the steaming cup of tea, as always.

He couldn’t take it no more.

“What is it that you wanted to say, Estelle?”

“Did you know that our tongue is the most tasteful when the food is lukewarm? About twenty-four degrees.”

What inane thing was she talking about this time?

“No, I didn’t.”

“What do you think my favorite taste is?” She stared him in the eyes.

“I have to go with sweetness.”

“It’s bitterness, Hylon.” The teacup made a clack as it met the saucer. “Here, I made this for you.”

She slid a neatly folded handkerchief towards him. Opening it, a gilded rose with a red stem greeted him. It was remarkably well made.

“Did you make this?” He felt a smile bloom on his face. It wasn’t difficult to see the symbolism, the gold part was him, and the red part was her. What a surprising gift, he thought.

“I did. Had I known you would like it that much, I would have given it to you sooner.”

“Heh, why didn’t you?”

“Soon enough that you would receive mine first.”

“Huh?” He saw her knuckles tighten.

“Did you like the handkerchief Esther made that much?”

She was talking about what happened last week. He had been sitting in the student council room pouring over some work when the only other person in the room, Esther, suddenly let out a laugh. Shocked, he stopped what he was doing and went over to where she sat.

“Oh, Hylon. Sorry about that.” She was smiling about something. “Look at this handkerchief I made. Isn’t it silly?”

She held a handkerchief with an image of a quite simplified frog. A roundish body with two stump arms and two bent legs. It didn’t have a neck as the head looked to be merged with the main body. Two black dots symbolized the eyes and for the mouth a single straight line was all it was. In Hylon’s eyes, it was more absurd than silly.

“It does look silly indeed.”

She furrowed her eyebrows unlike herself and pouted. “You don’t need to lie, you know?”

There it was again. How was she the only one that knew that he lied?

“Here you can have it.” She plopped it in his hand.

And so with the newly acquired handkerchief with that absurd frog, he put it in his room at the end of the day. Where it had stayed forgotten until now.

“Don’t tell me that is the only reason you called me here for? That she gave me a handkerchief as a joke?”

“Only reason? A joke? Tell me, have you ever told _me_ a joke?”

“Of course I have.” He told many joked to the people he knew.

“When.”

Surely there had to be one time he joked with her, right? Searching through his memories, not a single incident showed itself. Empty. Like his cup of tea.

She scoffed. “Now that’s funny.”

“Estelle—”

“Do you even care for me?” The table was a deep shade of red, painting all that was white away. The teacups that were empty, the teapot and saucers, and her clenched fingers that curled into themselves on the table.

Hylon could not finish what he wanted to say after that.

The flowers danced and the wind sang as a silence fell over the two. The tea had been brewing for a while, yet no one bothered to change the water. Letting it steep darker and darker. It was entirely undrinkable at this point. But even that did not stop his thoughts. His throat had gone dry from the heat whacking him in his blazer, all he had to do was move his hand to the teapot, grab the handle, and pour himself another cup. That’s all.

“Sorry to bother you two,” someone came to his rescue. “Have you seen Esther around here?”

“No we haven’t.” Answered Estelle.

“Really? Where could she have gone?” She truly was the saintess.

  
\*\*\* TK consider new chapter instead

  
Hot. The sun was way too hot, thought Esther. And noisy too. Like crickets with speakers tied to their legs, the cheers and jeers and woos and haas, echoed in her head, bouncing around wherever her thoughts didn’t already occupy. And let me tell you, Esther didn’t think about much around this time.

Walking around in a daze, she went wherever it wasn’t hot, and found herself standing in front of a stairwell. What floor was she on? It didn’t really matter but knowing it would be nice. She could choose to go up to the roof if it was a high number or down if it was a lower number.

The roof sounded pleasant, imagine feeling the wind in your hair as it softly wrapped around you. Whish, whish, it would whisper in your ear. What a whimsical sound.

“Whish, whish.” She hummed.

The roof was quite far, did she start at the first floor by mistake? How silly. Exercising was fine and all, but it was much too tiring.

Oh, did you hear that Esther? There were some people talking below you. Actually, they were arguing. About what? It piqued Esther’s interest and she turned around to walk down again. Down the steps that looked to continue downwards into infinity. How scary.

“Oh, it’s Lucas. What is he doing here?”

Esther was about skip over and slap her fellow tall classmate on the back when he suddenly floated in front of her. Like a butterfly with its wings cut, he barreled down the infinite steps.

On the first step, Lucas tried to shield his head and therefore smashed his wrist against the solid corner of the granite stair. The cracking sound from his wrist-bone indicated that it was at the least a fracture, and at the most a full break. Esther had broken her wrist once, it wasn’t pleasant and she had to walk around with a cast for a full month. At least the signature she collected was fun.

On the second step, his knee hit another corner. What an unlucky fellow. All he had to do was pull his leg towards his belly and let the leg muscles absorb the fall. Tsk, tsk. This was why learning how to fall was so important. His kneecap was in all likelihood be shattered in at least three pieces. At least the patellar tendon didn’t get injured.

With the momentum that seemed to only accelerate, his body bounced as he smashed his back. Ouch. I hope he didn’t hurt his spinal cord. It was a sensitive thing after all. A single, well-placed stab with a knife was enough to render a person useless. The vertebrae may look like it would easily deflect it, with it’s exotic shape, but from experience, it was easier to pierce through the discs than to spread cold butter on a freshly baked slice of bread. Just thinking about the countless ripped breads made Esther feel a bit bitter.

The next bounce was to Lucas’ neck. It bent in an unnatural angle of about twenty-four degrees. Never again would Lucas be able to move neck, let alone his body. That angle had surely severed his spinal cord and cut off the signals coming from his brain. Six minutes later and he could be legally be declared brain-dead. He looked quite shocked as his eyes didn’t even close.

He bounced a few times more down the steps, but there wasn’t anything interesting about them to share. Well, he did start bleeding from his head, however, wasn't that to be expected? It took quite a while to walk up the stairs, so imagine rolling down them.

Two broken arms, two broken legs, and two open eyes that stared at Esther on a crooked head. The blood had started to pool around him.

“Hey, Lucas. Are you dead?”

She crouched down and poked him in the belly.

“How silly.”

She sat and stared as his face went paler and paler and his eyes lost their focus.

“Esther, are you here!” Two other voices joined in the voice calling her name.

“Listen, Lucas. It’s my friends.” Their steps seemed to know where she was as they came closer and closer.

“Esther, there you are— What the hell?” That’s Eric.

“Eric, you shouldn’t swear… Gasp!” That’s Lavenza.

“What’s wrong you two?” And that’s Phila. They were all her friends.

“Hey guys!” Esther waved at them.

Eric was the first to move as he sprinted toward Esther and yanked her away from Lucas’ side. It was quite painful. Then it was Lavenza who knelt down beside him. Phila? Poor thing looked ready to collapse.

A pretty golden circle manifested in Lavenza’s hands as she started her sparkly magic spell.

“It’s useless, Lavenza. He’s already dead.”

“Don’t say that!” The light bounced off his lukewarm body.

“You’re wasting your energy.” The blinding light irritated her.

“I don’t care! The Goddess gave me this power for a reason!” TK on-the-nose

Tsk. The Goddess.

“Lavenza. Stop.”

“I can do it!” It flashed and flashed on the tears that rolled down her face.

“I said stop it.”

“No!”

“Stop it!” Esther yelled from behind Eric. Enough was enough.

“He’s already dead damn it!” Her shout echoed through the stairwell where the five students, one of them dead, were on this unusually hot summerTK day.

**Chapter 39:**
===============

A meeting was called with all the teachers and the headmaster. From the elderly embroidery teacher, and all the way to the strict history teacher. An extraordinary event had befallen the academy for the first time since its genesis.

“How many students witnessed the scene?” The headmaster asked.

“Four, sir.”

“And the area has been cordoned off?”

“Correct, we started a controlled fire and provided housing in the capital for the students affected.”

“What a tragedy.” He massaged the lines that had formed above his nose. “Make sure the Prince and Walter Johnstone has everything they need. And someone go ask the church to prepare a funeral. Armen, please go check on the other four students.”

“All four, headmaster?”

He sighed. “We can’t do that now can we?”

\*\*\*

“What were you doing at the boy’s dormitory?” Hylon asked the blond girl in front of him.

“I don’t know.”

“You don’t know?” It didn’t appear that she lied judging from her demeanor, but that only made it make less sense.

“You walked from the fencing grounds all the way to the third floor of the boy’s dormitory, and you don’t know?” He tapped the map spread in front of him. “It’s quite a distance to walk.”

“I wasn’t in my right mind that day. I was there before I realized.”

Again. He couldn’t see that she lied. Her eyes were far too calm, and her breathing was constant, about sixteen inhales per minute.

“So you are telling me you had a bout of insanity and lost you memories?”

“I’m not insane.” She hissed.

Hylon straightened his back. That reaction was not something he had anticipated.

“Your Highness… Maybe we should—”

“Did you push Lucas?”

She averted her eyes. “…I don’t know.”

“Esther, don’t worry. We will find the one who really did it, all right?” Walter tried to reassure the girl. What he got in reply was silence.

“Esther Nikodemus, you are to be confined in your room until further notice.” The order made from the prince made his stomach drop. After making sure her small figure left the makeshift interrogation room, he had to speak up.

“Isn’t that too harsh? We don’t even have all the facts yet. All we know is that he was pushed.”

“That’s exactly why. She is the most likely culprit.”

“Hylon, you can’t be serious can you? You really think she did it? She’s your fiance’s cousin!” He even dropped his usual honorifics.

“Ha… I don’t know what I’m supposed to think. I would have never predicted that something like this would happen on academy grounds.”

Walter leapt up from his chair. “You should let her free then!”

“Walter.” Hylon looked at his aide. “Don’t let your feelings cloud your judgment.”

It wasn’t pleasant to act like his superior, but Hylon hoped that behind his scrunched up face, he would understand. Hylon wanted above all else to declare her innocent, but with no evidence to latch on, he couldn’t. This matter fell under his responsibility and failure would not be tolerated.

He looked at the transcript with the three other witnesses: Eric, Phila and Lavenza. They all described the same thing. When they arrived at the third floor to look for Esther, she was already crouching over the dead body of Lucas. “And then she waved us over.” That same line was written in all three transcripts.

All of them had an alibi as they had ventured together, and it wasn’t hard to spot the saintess’ hair color. A total of thirty-three students had seen her, Hylon and Estelle being two of them. Esther on the other hand… Zero witness accounts.

“Does that make sense? How can no one have seen her walk all that way?”

\*\*\*  
  
Confinement. Would this happen to me too if I hadn’t died that day? It was surprisingly… boring. Stuck on the top floor of the dormitory, I had finally gotten my own room. However the only entertainment I had was the faint murmurs below my window.

The history teacher, Armen, acted as a guard, standing in front of my door neither letting anyone enter nor leave. It suited him better to stand there than to lecture us behind a podium.

A day had passed since I came to. My last memory was of me looking down at Lucas’ corpse together with the others. No other memories came to mind when trying to recall earlier memories than that. It was as if someone had opened up my head and played with my brain. They were must have had much fun as they plucked it apart, leaving empty gaps for me to wander in. This was the second time this happened. The first time was the days after I killed Alice.

I had attributed it to catching a fever and entering a delirium, but now that it happened twice, and under the same circumstances? Did I kill Lucas?

Too exhausting. I slumped into bed, too exhausted to think. The Goddess would surely have stopped me somehow. Like she always did. It couldn’t be me. Right, there were rules for this.

I stared out of the window until the bright morning sun suddenly blackened and the moon took it’s place.

“Esther, I’m coming in.”

It was Estelle who visited me. The tray of food she held made me remember that a person had to eat.

“Have you been in bed the whole time? You didn’t even finish lunch.”

“Leave me alone.”

She swapped the tray with a fresh one. It was some type of soup and bread this time.

“You should eat something.”

I pulled the blanket up to my eyes. “I don’t want to.”

“Don’t tell me you are planning to starve yourself? From personal experience, it doesn’t give the result you want.” I looked at her.

“Estelle, why are you here?” Phila was the one who brought me lunch.

“Phila asked Eric.”

“So?”

“And he asked Walter, who then asked me.”

“Passed around like a sack of potatoes.”

“Funny.” She smiled a bit.

“How are the others?”

“They are quite shocked, and rightly so. They spend most of their time in the student council room.”

“Does Lucas’ parents know?”

“The headmaster visited them this morning.”

“I see.” The warbling steam coming from the soup made me feel dizzy.

“Did you do it?”

“Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t. I honestly don’t know.”

There was a mirror in this room. Before Estelle had arrived, and even before Phila had arrived, I used it. My cheek had a spot on it, you see. A dirty brown dot a little under my left eye. No matter how many times I picked at it, rubbed with my hand until the skin turned red, scratched with my nail until another mark appeared. It wouldn’t disappear. Only after taking off my glove did I realize, it was the mirror that was dirty. Not me. And so I talked to it.

“I’m Esther Nikodemus.” No reply.

“My mom is Victoria Nikodemus.” No reply.

I pushed Lucas, I mouthed under the golden circle that appeared.

I didn’t push Lucas. Again, it appeared.

Two statements, and two answers.

“Are you playing with me, my Goddess? Having fun are we?”

Estelle had long left my room and the sun was outside my window again somehow.

“Esther? Can I come in?”

It was Walter who visited me. He had in his hands what looked like some magic tool.

“So listen,” he started to talk about how he discussed with prince Hylon and the headmaster about my predicament. They couldn’t let me walk around freely without cause, but since the three other witnesses were in my favor, they came up with a compromise. Provided that I was never to be left alone, I would be able to walk around if I were to agree with wearing the tracking device he held.

Originally meant as a punishment for class-skipping delinquents, the metal bangle proved to be useful to make sure potential criminals wouldn’t be able to run.

Opening it like a clam, he wrapped it around my left wrist. It was cold to the touch.

“Aren’t you glad? You can walk around now.” He smiled. “Shall we go get breakfast?”

I thought about smashing my wrist against the door, but decided not to. My stomach was feeling a bit peckish.

\*\*\*  
"Hey, look at her. Isn’t that armband meant for troublemakers? She always acted so proper, now look at her.”

“Shh! She is going to hear you. You don’t want to end up on her bad side.”

“Why not?”

“Well, for one, she’s on the student council.”

“She probably used her name or something, how can a student with a shared room be accepted otherwise?”

“Hah, she does have a room for herself now.” Said the people on my left.

  

“I can’t believe someone started a fire there of all places. My friend had to move out on the day you know? He’s so lucky…”

“I’m just glad nothing more serious happened.”

“Like what? The headmaster puts our protection above else you know? Didn’t you hear his speech?”

“It was just a hypothetical, why are you getting angry?”

“I’m not angry?” Said the people on my right.

  

“Does your copy still have that passage about the dead girl?”

“You mean the witch?”

“Witch, girl, whatever it is, do you have it?”

“I don’t think anyone has that part anymore. Why are you interested in it?”

“I can’t shake off this feeling that I’ve seen her somewhere before.”

“Wow… Gross man, what are you studying at night?”

“Hey! What are you trying to insinuate!” Said the people that sat behind Walter.

My food was starting to lose its heat.

“Is it not to your liking?” He asked me.

Two slices of bread were smothering a fried piece of chicken like a vice. The oil and fat had melted and trickled down the leaves of spinach that tried its best to not get soggy. A chicken sandwich in other words. Once a crisp thing, time had rendered the dish into a mush of soggy bread, soggy greens and soggy breaded chicken. It didn’t look appetizing. Taking a bite confirmed my beliefs as the texture reminded me of wet sand. There had to be something wrong with mine because Walter looked to enjoy it.

“Speaking of which,” I said. “I don’t see Eric or Phila here.”

“They have already eaten.”

“Is that so.” I stitched together the piece of bread that had crumbled.

“Do you want to meet them? I’m sure they will be glad to see you.”

My hands twitched. “Will you be following me around the whole day? You must be rich to have that much time on your hands.” He adjusted his thick glasses.

“Something terrible did happen after all. A little switch in my routine will by good for me.”

“What about the student council.”

“You don’t need to worry about that,” his voice went up a pitch, “we got two new temporary pair of hands, and Estelle is doing a magnificent job holding down the fort.”

“Sorry for all this. Because of me, you all have to work extra.”

“As I said, you don’t have to worry about it. It was originally only I and his Highness after all.” He smiled a smidge. “I’m sure the investigation will go smoothly.”

I looked at him. “You don’t have any questions?”

“About what?” He looked much too carefree.

“Nevermind… I’m going to ask for another sandwich.”

Pulling back my chair, something bumped into my side hard enough for me to let out a sound. Crash. Splash and clatter. What greeted me when I stood up was a tray of food. My uniform was soaked with some yellow sticky liquid. Half a sandwich laid on my shoes and a fork and knife laid around me, like ships gathering around a lighthouse.

“Not this again…” The boy holding his empty tray said under his breath. “Are you all right?” It was Siegfried.

“Hey,” I said. “Are you blind? Or do you get something out of doing this?”

“I’m sorry all right? I didn’t see you stand up.”

“Hah, so you really are blind. I didn’t know our academy accepted people like you.”

“You’re pushing it, Esther.” He clenched his teeth.

“Don’t say my name like you know me, you scoundrel.”

“Say that again?” He took a step forward, prompting Walter to take a step as well.

“How about we calm down a little you two?”

“She just insulted my name!”

“Hah, look at you. What will you do then? Throw a glove at me and challenge me to a duel? We all saw how that ended didn’t we?”

“You!” He tried to grab at me, and ended up being stopped by Walter instead.

“Hah! This must be what Lucas felt that day!”

He stopped moving. “What did you say?”

“What a pitiful person, to end up like that for no reason!”

“Esther, what are you doing?” Walter looked at me with a stupid expression.

“What do you know!”

“What I know?”

“Don’t say it, Esther!”

“I know absolutely nothing! Isn’t that just so hilarious!”

Look at me everyone! Watch with your eyes a person that knows nothing! Commit it to your memory because I sure can’t! Talk among yourselves, murmur among yourselves. And call me a witch if you want to. Because I don’t know anymore.

“What am I even doing here…” I want to go home.

Rapid footsteps approached us and sent the statue that was Siegfried flying into the nearby chairs. The nearby students let out some yells or something.

“I’ve had enough of your crap, Siegfried! How dare you hurt her!” Eric had punched him quite far.

**Chapter 40: Investigation and Lavenza’s heart**
=================================================

“I’m sorry Walter, but leave me alone for today, will you?” He heard the girl say half-hiding behind her door.

Her face was always a tad monotone, a rare upturned mouth-corner there and a raised eyebrow here. He thought that was the extent of her emotions, some people were like that after all. Like her cousin. Yet, what had transpired in the cafeteria earlier forced him to reevaluate what he knew about her. The same with Eric.

Always acting a bit aloof and confident, he did not expect him to barge in and do that kind of thing. Such violence was rare and he would in normal circumstances condemned it. But just this one time, he felt that it was deserved. Seeing Esther stand there, with her soiled uniform, being accosted by him was not pleasant at all. All Walter thought in that moment was to ensure he didn't get physical with her.

These last days have been much to chaotic.

“Should I send for someone? Maybe Eric?”

“This is the girl’s dormitory, Walter.” She closed the door on him.

“She didn’t even take a bite…”

Taking out the watch from his inner pocket, it was time for him to meet up with prince Hylon.

\*\*\*

“What do these wounds tell you, Walter?” He looked at the dead body.

“The hand fracture indicates that he was still conscious when he fell. Trying to protect his head, the wrist here,” he pointed on the corpse, “took the brunt of the fall.”

“The hand fracture indicates that as he was falling, his reflexes made him shield his head. The wrist here,” he pointed on the corpse, “took the brunt of the fall and shattered on the granite stairs.”

“And that means he was conscious when he fell.”

“Your Highness, couldn’t it have been an accident? Perhaps he turned his ankle or lost his balance? It was rather hot that day.”

“Do you have the diagram of the scene?” Walter riffled through his folder and took out a page with some lines and shapes on it. “Look where his body hit the stairs, and where his footprints were last detected.”

Using his light magic, it wasn’t difficult to figure out these details. Footprints, sign of life, and detecting blood. It’s full range of application was unknown to even Walter, who followed after the prince wherever he went.

“Even if you fell down some stairs, you would not be able to fall that far. In other words, he was pushed. This was a deliberate attempt by someone to cause harm.”

Walter already knew but still found it hard to believe.

“Why would someone in the academy do that?”

The prince grinned. “That’s why we’re here is it not?”

He always did that. Grinning while examining a dead body. Walter had been a bit flabbergasted the first time, but after all this time, the expression on his face felt reassuring.

Poking and prodding at the dead body, the two of them discussed and noted down their findings. There wasn’t much that went against their hypothesis.

“How is Esther doing?” He wiped some blood that got on his hands.

“She seems to be deeply affected by this.”

“Hmm. Affected how?”

Walter readjusted his glasses. “She doesn’t leave her room that much. A person needs to move around to be healthy, right?”

“Hmm. We better find something that can help her with that then.” TK magic or smt idk. “Let’s reexamine the scene, we may have missed something.”

\*\*\*  
"Good morning your Highness!” Some first year’s bowed their head quite enthusiastically.

“What did I tell you guys? I’m just a normal student like you while in the academy. Stop with the formalities” He beamed.

“Y-yes sir!” Hylon watched as the budding new students skipped away talking quite loudly about how bright and comfortable he made them. Unlike those other uptight nobles that frowned their noses at everything.

They had arrived at the boy’s dormitory that on the surface had been vandalized by a student playing around with fire. The bottom of the stairs were still having signs of being burnt as some of the granite plates were cracked and sooty. Some students walking to and fro from class avoided the spot like the plague as they tipped around to the sides on the steps.

‘Which idiot started a fire in this weather,” Hylon heard someone say.

A considerable time had passed since that day, and he didn’t really think that some new clue would welcome him. Even if he did, the evidence would need even further investigation as the numerous students walking about meant that there was a high chance of it being contaminated.

Nevertheless, this had to be done. Crouching down on the ground, he started picking up the hairs and dust that had collected. A few onlookers raised their eyebrows but Walter standing beside him only smiled at them. ‘Don’t worry about it’, he seemed to project.

“Do you have the list of all the students on this floor and the next?” He asked Walter.

Name, age and what year they were in were written in neat letters.

Pulling in the ether to his fingers, he rubbed the strand of hair with his fingertips.

“Mark down second-year Jake for questioning.” Standing behind the crouched prince, Walter noted the name.

“Mark down the fourth-year Marcus.” And the next name after that.

Without moving and without taking a break, the prince continued to rattle off names each time he plucked a new strand of hair, and Walter would extend the list by one. They continued until the onlookers stopped looking and the students stopped walking around.

\*\*\* TK consider extending and making this part a full chapter

  
In the girl’s dormitory, in one of the rooms that only had a single bed, a white-haired girl was kneeling beside her bed.

Lavenza failed to use her powers again. No matter how hard she tried, and no matter how much she prayed. What was dead could not live again.

At the start of her TKfindcorrecttimeframe year-long journey, she had been excited. Views she hadn’t seen before in her territory, food that tasted rough but still tasted good, and countless people that her help. It was good practice and seeing their happy faces made Lavenza too, feel happy. And then she met a blond girl that introduced herself as Esther. She was the first one that her magic didn’t work on.

In the next city in her journey, she meet other people that needed her help. These were worse for wear and bumps could be clearly seen on their hands, arms and faces. Noel, her travel-companion, wasn’t entirely enthusiastic that she wanted to help these sick people. Too dangerous, he said. There had to be reason why the slums were crammed with these sick people. All the more reason to help them, she thought and dragged with him with her.

Lying in a room by herself she rented, Lavenza’s heart felt heavy that night.

That was the second time her magic didn’t work on someone.

For each new city she visited, the more people began to recognize her. ‘Thank you, saintess!’ The people started to say each time she healed them. ‘I’m not a saintess,’ she said back. But no one listened to her humble words and so the title stuck.

“Oh Goddess…” Lavenza prayed in her dorm room. “Am I doing the right thing?”

She had been acquitted of suspicion on the account of her name and the fact that prince Hylon precised that Lucas had been dead long before the three of them arrived. That left Esther as the lone suspect who was placed under confinement.

Lavenza tried to appeal to Hylon that there was no way she was the culprit, that she had only been there by coincidence and that it had to be an accident, that no one pushed him. But he was firm. Firm as a prince should be. “Look at the footprints. Someone falling by themself wouldn’t be able to skip that many steps.” In the end, she could do naught but grit her teeth and relent.

“Why is it that some people can’t be healed? Are they cursed? Are they sinners? Or is it all just a coincidence?” She stared at the miniature statue of the Goddess in her hands. “Why must we die?”

Those sick people in that city had died a short while after her visit. The invisible people she couldn’t meet would die. A letter told her the details of her friend’s death. The funeral was already over when she received it. And now the student she had talked to a few times had died in her hands at the bottom of some stairs.

“What use is this power…” Her voice wavered.

“What is the point if I can’t save everyone!” It was too sad. It was too hard. For this young Saintess.

Having emptied her tears, she went to the window to cool herself. And there she saw something golden sparkling in the moonlight. Her nightgown made her look like a ghost as she slid away from the dormitory, into the courtyard below.

“Esther?” What was she doing outside her room?

\*\*\*  
On the rare nights I got some sleep, I kept having these weird dreams. All of them ended when I died. Like a personal purgatory for me to experience all kinds of deaths. Yesterday I was shot. Tomorrow I was falling. And today I was standing in front of a big tree, in my hands a rough rope. The strands that didn’t conform to the twisting figure stuck out like sore thumbs and tickled my bare hands.

How did I know that this was a dream? Easy. I didn’t wear my gloves when I dreamt. I took solace in this fact as I kept dying.

“You want me to do it myself this time?” I spoke to no one in particular. “Suit yourself then.”

Taking one of the ends, I pulled it through a loop and around itself a few times. It was expertly done I must say. A round circle at the top with thick tail below. I thought of finding some cake after this.

“It sure is cold for being a dream.” Couldn’t they have given me a coat? I thought about the warm bed that waited for me.

I opened the noose to let my head fit through. Like a crown that only the finest kings and queens were permitted to use, the crown made out of hemp sat atop my hair with all its extravagance. Silly me, I miscalculated the circumference. Adjusting the noose was quite difficult as I had tightened it considerably. However, a little trick I learnt was to push the knot together instead of trying to dig into it with your nails. Doing it this way spared the finger muscles and a lot of sweat and time.

“Esther! What are you doing!” Someone shook my shoulder hard enough to make me drop the noose. The rope lying between the grass almost made it look like a snake.

“Lavenza. Why are you here? Are you here to watch?” I didn’t take her to be one interested in such things. But what did I know about her? She had white hair that made her look like a ghost, she had magic healing powers that only select people had, and… she was good at hand massages.

“I just need to fix this knot, it doesn’t fit my head, you see.” She raised her hand.

Then she slapped me. “What are you saying!”

It hurt. I didn’t know what to feel about that.

\*\*\* TK Chapter break maybe

  
"I’m sorry for hitting you…” Lavenza applied some ointment on the girl’s face that had a red hand print.

“It’s fine,” she said wincing each time the ointment spread.

Because the rules stated that she were to not leave her confinement without being accompanied by someone, they moved to her room. It didn’t have any noticeable items that popped out, save for the pair of gloves on the nightstand and the mirror on the wall with a cloth draped over it.

“It was the first reaction I had. I didn’t really mean it.”

The lamp on the nightstand cast its dim orange light to the two of them. Esther sat on the edge of the bed still in her nightgown that had green and brown stains at the hem. And not to talk about her slippers. Even if the most experienced maid washed them, there would be little hope that its once white color would return back.

With the ointment fully applied, her cheek glistened with a pinkish color. The swelling had settled a bit and luckily enough, Lavenza slapped her in such a way that her nails didn’t touch. Violence was truly a scary thing, she thought. Such a small impulsive action could potentially ruin a person’s life.

She sighed. “It’s understandable.”

Lavenza gripped the jar in her hands. “Can you tell me why you did that?”

Seeing her stand there by the tree in the night, she thought Esther was star-gazing. It was such a clear night sky after all; the stars twinkled in the serene dance of the moon, soothing her troubled mind. Each night, the moon would visit them, and each morning the sun would visit too. Like a reminder that a new day would always come. Yet, the girl looking upwards at the canopy blocking this very same sky, tested her adage.

For she had thrown a rope across one of its sturdy branches.

Lavenza tried to look into the girl’s eyes, but she averted her gaze each time. It was similar to how one of the children she met on her journey acted. That girl had been caught stealing bread by Noel and she wanted to know why she would do that. The child had a reasonable reason, to feed her younger siblings. They let her go with an extra silver coin, much to Noel’s displeasure.

“I thought it was a dream…” But the answer coming from this girl was not reasonable.

“And that makes it all right? Why would you even think of doing that in a dream?”

Esther looked down at her ruined slippers. “You can’t die in a dream.”

“Esther!” The girl’s face winched at her yell. “Why would you want to test that!”

What would have happened if she hadn’t arrived in time? If she had tied the noose loose enough to fit her neck the first time? Another tragedy to loom over the academy? One of her friends had already died and now another wanted to do the same? It was painful, her heart. And the glare Esther gave her.

“Because I wouldn’t be able to wake up otherwise! How was I supposed to know It wasn’t a dream, huh?” What did she mean by that? “Don’t shout at me as if you know everything!”

Esther raised herself up, looking down at a speechless Lavenza.

“Do you know how many times I have died in my dreams?! How painful it is each time! You don’t! Because you have never died before! You would just use that useless healing magic!”

Lavenza cried back. “It’s not useless!” It couldn’t be.

She laughed in her face. “The what about this?” She showed off her hand. “And what about Lucas!”

Not that different from the hand in her face, his corpse popped into her head. Like it did for the past days. All she could offer him that day was a paltry prayer to ensure his soul would venture safely to the Goddess. All she could offer was to send his soul away.

“Why were you there, Esther.” Her voice wasn’t her own.

“What? You think I know!”

“You were there! What happened to him!” Was it guilt that she couldn’t save him? Or anger. “How can you not know! You were there before us!”

“I don’t know!”

Lavenza was angry. So she said something she should never have. “Did you do it?”

Her friend stopped moving, opening her eyes wide instead. She had begun crying at some point.

“Get out.”

The ice-cold voice made Lavenza catch herself thinking: “what was she doing?” Her friend stood there in her dirty nightgown, in this room that had only the bare minimum. Tears rolling down her reddened cheeks below the crying eyebrows.

“Esther, I didn’t mean to say that.” She really didn’t.

“Get out of my room, Lavenza.”

“I know you didn’t do it, I just…”

She turned around, revealing her cold tiny back. “I’m tired.”

Lavenza leapt forward, holding back her shoulders to prevent her climbing into the solitary bed.

“Esther… I’m sorry…”

“Then show it.” A blank expression greeted Lavenza. Her hands were being grabbed as they were slowly led through the air. Esther stared into her eyes as their hands ended up below her chin. From her fingers, Lavenza felt the warmth coming from the fragile neck. They were wrapped around it.

“Kill me right here and now.” Then she smiled. “Because this must be another dream.”

Before Lavenza could process the situation, the girl in her hands went limp and fell to the bed, dragging her with her. Pinned under her, she looked pitiful. Swollen eyes, a swollen cheek and dark circles. Hair with split ends sticking out everywhere. She didn’t look healthy.

“Esther…” She opted to watch over her tonight. Dabbing away the tears that seemed to slow endlessly as she slept. The room was dead silent, even as her chest rose and fell with her breaths. Lavenza hoped this would pass quickly. It was all too much.

\*\*\*

The electric bell announced a new customer.

"Hello! Welcome to our flower shop, do you need help with anything?”

“Which flowers are suitable for a funeral?”

“Oh, my condolences… May I ask for who it is for?”

“My mom.”

“Then I would believe these white lilies would be the best.” The employee pointed at the bouquet.

“Any other flowers?”

“How about these white roses? You may think they are best suited for weddings and the like. However their original purpose was to give a soul a peaceful transition to the afterlife. Isn’t that just magical? I think these would be the best choice.”

The customer didn’t say anything.

“We also have some other’s if you want to see?”

“I will take the roses.”

Packing with a deft hand, the employee gave the wrapped bouquet to the customer in black.

“Thank you for your patronage, I hope you will have a good day.”

“Right.” The bell on the door rang when they left.

“Oh.” Her phone rang. “Is that you Ann? What stupid thing are you going to say this time?”

**Chapter 41:**
===============

TK don’t use eshter pov for a while.

Phila woke in her room again and did her morning routine as usual, pat the bed to make it straight and fluffy, put on her ironed uniform and get ready for class, and help her roommate, Esther, with tying her hair-ribbon. If she had been here. Confined on the top floor of the dormitory, she hadn’t seen her for a while. Two days? Three days? It depended on when she stumbled upon a corpse for the first time in her life.

Lucas was the tallest person she had seen, his head appeared to touch the top of the doorframes, so seeing him lie there crumpled together, she felt confused.

“No Phila! You have to stay positive!” She cheered herself in front of the mirror.

Raising her fists, she tried to pump them. “Stay positive…” It was hard.

Phila slumped towards her first class of the day and it was luckily practical-Tuesday today. Meaning she didn’t have to use her brain that much. Because it was mush from all the thoughts that hammered in her head.

“Phila!” Her friends waved her over. “Come sit with us!” The shorter one was Henriette and the taller one was Sara. With these two, she had been adventuring in the capital a decent amount of times. Eating in not-so-expensive restaurants and collecting souvenirs and oddities, Phila had done a lot in her free time and her weekends were seldom filled with boringness. Waving back, she walked over to them, passing Estelle who now sat alone in her private row of chairs.

Esther didn’t show up today either.

Would it be selfish for her to feel a little relieved? The first meeting she had with her was tragic and she thought for sure she would change rooms. Nevertheless, like two peas in a pod they had moved through the academy together.

A head of pink and a head of gold. That combination seemed to attract all sorts of things, from striking a deal with the headmaster himself, to being surrounded by the most powerful children in the kingdom. It was too exciting for poor little Phila to handle. She had only planned to live a quiet academic life after all.

“Hey what’s up with Esther? Is it really true that she got permission to ditch class from the teacher?”

“I wouldn’t call it ditching… She’s just feeling a bit unwell?”

“Hah, if being sick is all it took to get a private room, then maybe I should go eat some sand. Must be nice to have a rich family.”

She wanted to correct her friend and protect Esther’s reputation, tell them that it wasn’t really a private room, tell them that she was confined, tell them that someone had died. Yet she couldn’t. In the end, all she managed was a smile.

“Phila.” She heard someone below her say. “Class is starting, tell your friends to be quiet.”

“Yikes, the Ice Queen is glaring at us…” That was Estelle’s nickname by the way. No one knew where the nickname originated from, but looking at her still face, it felt inevitable. Oh, and Esther’s nickname? Ice Princess. At least it wasn’t Ice Witch, thought Phila. She could already imagine her frowning face if that nickname was used instead.

With class over in a jiffy, it was time to head for the cafeteria and eat some lunch. Today’s menu was delicious as always. She dared to even say it was better than her uncle’s.

“Tell me honestly, Phila.” The short friend said. “You had a fight with her didn’t you?”

“Huh?”

“Who was it about? Siegfried?—”

“Yuck.” The taller friend said.

“Yeah, you’re right. It must be Eric or Walter then.”

“I don’t understand what you two are saying?”

“Don’t be daft Phila, we’re talking about boys!” She smacked the table, giving the roll of bread a jump. “How can you always be surrounded by such handsome people?”

“Their handsomeness must have rendered her blind.”

Phila got a fork pointed at her. “So who was it? Who did you fight over?”

Like a clock that struck twelve, nearly spilling her glass of water, Phila shot up from her seat. “What ridiculous thing are you saying!” An echo going ‘ing-ing-ing’ bounced around the hall for all the staring students to hear.

“Ah, it must have been true.”

“Please sit down before another lunch turns into chaos, Phila.”

“We didn’t fight over some boy!”

“Right. Sure.”

“Well then what did you two fight over? Must have been pretty dramatic considering she even left you have a room for you own.”

Phila slumped down in her chair. “We didn’t fight about anything… Like I told you, she’s feeling unwell.”

“Is that why she haven’t shown herself since that day? Phew, it felt satisfying when Eric sent Siegfried flying.”

“Must be because of shame then. Imagine having three boys wrapped around her finger.”

“She’s not like that! Stop making her out to be some men-seducing witch!” Phila immediately regretted uttering that word.

“Witch? That kind of suits her, no?

“Golden hair and eerie purple eyes, and the way she wears those gloves as if hiding something, I have to agree to that one.” TK expand on the glove part

“You two are going too far!” Despite her best efforts. The word spread around the student body like a cancer killing its host at the end of the day. TK show don’t tell?

“Phila, be honest. Don’t you feel relieved?”

What? Did she hear that right?

“Esther was just using you, you know? Take this situation with a positive outlook, you don’t need to play around with that uptight noble girl anymore. We could see how stressed she made you.”

“But I wasn’t—”

“It’s all right, Phila.” One of them held her hand. “We are your friends too, you know?”

The two of them nodded their heads at her, rhythmically, almost hypnotic.

“By the way, have you seen Lucas lately?”

\*\*\*

Busy at work, the student council room was filled with sounds of pens meeting paper and the occasional slap when Eric was finished with one. At least he was here, thought Phila. On her left sat the top-student Estelle Nikodemus and in front of her sat the prime minister’s son Walter Johnstone. The two pair of commoners had been roped into this room for the last few days somehow.

“Shouldn’t you still be in detention, Eric?” She asked.

“Today was my last day, chivalry was the reason sir Armen gave me.”

“Don’t expect to be so lucky next time.” Said Estelle, without stopping her work.

“Now, now. All’s well that ends well, right?”

“Walter, you should have stopped them before he even got the chance to throw a punch.”

“I— I know…”

Estelle stopped writing for a moment and looked toward Eric. “Thank you.”

Phila nearly popped her eyes out hearing those two words leave her mouth.

“Don’t even mention it. We’re all in this terrible situation together anyway.”

“At least wipe off that smirk on your face.”

“It’s my personality.”

She scoffed. “It’s annoying.” Phila sensed something tickle her brain witnessing this scene.

“And how goes the investigation? Anything that could free Esther from your unjust judgment?”

Walter adjusted his glasses. “Ignoring your scathe comment, all the one’s we have asked doesn’t appear know or have seen anything that day.”

“What if some of them lied?”

“Good luck lying in front of his Highness.”

“Yeah… Maybe you are right.” Phila shivered when she remembered being interrogated by him. “That list of yours, would Siegfried be on it by any chance?”

“Yes, and you too for your information, more than half the male students are on it.”

“You should question him.”

“Eric, wasn’t a punch enough for you?”

“I didn’t mean it like that. Its just that something he said is bothering me.”

“What would that be?”

“Don’t you remember? He said: What do you know? When she nearly revealed the situation. You wouldn’t say that normally if you didn’t know about if beforehand, would you?”

Walter cupped his mouth. “Huh, you’re right. That is odd.”

“Yeah, so bring him in for questioning. Maybe even bring Esther to see if it jogs her memory.”

“You’re surprisingly bright for your appearance, Eric,” said Estelle.

“I will take that as a compliment.”

\*\*\* Tk change scene into lavenza peeking at what esther is doing in the bathroom.  
Lavenza had woken up a while ago, yet she tried her best to not open her eyes. Sensing movement from her chair, she had remained quiet as the girl slipped on her slippers and slid in front of her. The she stood for who knows how long. Why didn’t she just open her eyes? Well, Lavenza didn’t know either. It just felt like the right thing to do.

Yesterday had been quite something so perhaps it was fear? Or embarrassment, maybe even both. If only it was a dream, she could pretend that last night didn’t happen.

Cracking open her eyes a smidge, she peeked at the girl’s thin ankles. It was really pale, almost blending in with the nightgown had it been clean. How much longer was she going to stand there? Her neck was starting to ache… Then the still-standing girl announced a sequence of sentences that made Lavenza’s heart drop.

“I’m Esther Nikodemus.”

“I’m not dreaming.”

“I’m not insane.”

Her eyes shot open, catching a glimpse of her back that entered the adjoining bathroom. In this private room that functioned as a prison.

\*\*\*  
“You should eat something.” Lavenza watched the girl reluctantly take a bite. She had gone to her own room to get changed and brought two portions of breakfast on the way.

“Did you sleep well?”

She nodded.

“That’s good.” Her eyes were still a bit swollen, but the dark circles had diminished enough to look faint.

“How about we take a stroll in the courtyard after? I can ask Prince Hylon or Walter if that is all right.” The magic bangle poked out from her sleeve like a stigma.

“Aren’t you busy? Class is starting soon.”

Lavenza made a smile. “Today’s a Saturday.”

“Oh. Well, if that’s fine with you… then I would like that…” She smiled even further hearing her meek words.

Leaving Esther alone to ready herself, Lavenza set out to the student council to find the aforementioned prince. She hoped he would be there today, lest she had half a day to search for him.

Opening the dormitory door, the outside view welcomed her to another new day. The gentle breeze played with her hair and cute little birds sang their songs greeting the morning sun. And with their sturdy stems, the flowers adorning the main pathway to the main building, danced happily along with the audience of grass. Lavenza took a deep breath and expanded her lungs to such a degree that her nose tingled.

Passing by the tree from yesterday’s, some students were having a picnic under it. A blanket was spread out under them, acting both as a barrier between their behinds and the grass, and a table to set their plates of refreshments on. It was novel sight, one would normally sit on chairs with an actual table, she thought. Nevertheless, the students appeared to have a cozy time. Maybe Esther would join her to try it out.

“Good morning, Lavenza!” One of students waved her hand. “Will you be going to the church again?”

“Maybe not today, I’ve made plans with a friend you see.” The students went wide-eyed.

“Really? I guess even the Saintess needs a break from that stuff.”

Lavenza chuckled. “I can’t be indoors on such a fine day, now can I?”

“You’re right about that.

“Ah, she’s too bright…” The students raised their arms to shield against her smile. She had to smile even more seeing the silly antics from her underclassmen.

“Even the Witch would be easily vanquished by her…”

“Witch?” Lavenza tilted her head.

“Yeah, there have been rumors about a witch in the academy lately.”

“Oh, it’s just a ghost-story that has spread around lately.” The student raised her fingers to her head, imitating horns.

“They say that late at night, if you listen closely, you can hear someone laughing by themselves around the hallways in the girl’s dormitory. And not just any floor, but the infamous fourth floor. Many have tried to see who it was that is laughing so late at night, and all have ended their treacherous journey with nothing but an empty hallway. Gone. Like the wind. The laughter coming from the witch was like a mockery to their bravery.”

“However, listen to this.” She cupped her mouth to make her whisper louder. “There have been people that said they saw the witch with their own eyes, yesterday. Some poor girl accidentally peeked between her curtains instead of sleeping and saw it.”

“Wandering in the courtyard in the cold nightly air, they said she wore nothing but a thin white dress. Her hair? Sparkly like strands of gold. And in her hands, a rope thick enough to trap a monster.”

The other student interrupted. “Sounds more like a ghost to me.”

“Ehh, but a witch sounds more interesting, don’t you remember how everyone talked about the one in the book?”

“If you say so.”

Lavenza felt a clump rise in her throat. “Do you know who was it that saw her?”

“Oho, are you interested?” She smiled. “No one actually knows who it was that witnessed it.”

“It was probably some made up story that you were too dumb to notice.”

“What? But it’s fun isn’t it?”

The two students began to bicker in the shade’s tree, leaving Lavenza an opportunity to continue on her merry way. They were too occupied with their thoughts to say their farewells.

About to enter the student council room, a loud noise from inside made her hesitate to open the door for a moment. The same towers of documents were to be seen on the desks and chairs, however the usual ink pens that seemed to never get a rest, were strewn across the floor. Right between the two members facing each other while standing, Estelle and Prince Hylon.

“Oh, Lavenza. What brings you here?” He touched his tie to fix it.

“Am I interrupting something?”

“No, we just finished up,” said Estelle. Making sure not to crease her skirt, she bent down to pick up the pens that had stopped rolling on the floor. Then she sat down in her desk and began reading over the documents that appeared to have no end to them.

“I wanted to ask if I could accompany Esther on a walk?”

“You must have walked by Walter then, he already went to fetch her.”

“Fetch her? Why?”

Estelle spoke up: “Because confining her wasn’t enough for the two of them.”

**Chapter 42:**
===============

TK detective sheeit, they find out a clue about siegfried and interogates him. “Why is she here” rope in esther somehow

Hylon looked over the list of names that Walter gave him. Starting from the top, a dozen names were crossed off until the lines reached the last quarter of the page.

Under the guise of partaking in a survey, the two of them had pulled in students to ask about their whereabouts on that unusually hot day. The none-the-wiser students looked to enjoy themselves having a chat with the charismatic second prince and cool prime minister’s son, telling all sorts of things, what they saw, what they heard and what their thoughts were. Hylon smiled all the while Walter wrote down everything they said.

Today was a tad different. Two others were joining them under the guise of a survey, Esther, the girl he had the most suspicion over, and her cousin Estelle. Who asked nicely to join them.

The reason he brought Esther was because Walter had asked him quite fervently to do it. According to him, Eric said that one of the students on the list acted suspiciously. But what would he know about people acting suspicious. A mere merchant’s apprentice.

“How about him, Esther? Did you remember anything?” Walter said after the last student left the room.

“I’ve never seen him before.”

“But he’s in your theology class…”

Hylon looked at the blank girl who lost her memories. Even if the shock of seeing a corpse for the first time were that serious, it was far too convenient and inconvenient for her to not remember. And the most intriguing part was that she didn’t lie, or at least believed herself that she didn’t remember. Hylon was sure of that.

“Who’s next?”

“It’s Eric, your Highness.”

Esther and Estelle furrowed their brows in the same manner. “Why is he called here?” Asked the younger cousin.

“That’s just how it is. Tell him to come in.”

The door opened. “Good morning everyone, I see that the whole student council is here today. Are you doing all right, Esther?” She nodded in reply.

“Since you are already aware of the situation, let me just ask one question.”

“Sure.”

“Do you think Esther did it?”

“Hylon.” Estelle glared at him.

“Hmm.” Eric smirked. “No I do not. She’s not someone capable of doing that, trust me.”

Hylon observed the girls face. Nothing. Not even a twitch on her ears.

“You can send in the next person, Eric.”

TK maybe wrong tone judging from previous chapter

Eric raised a brow. “That’s it? This is the method you have devised to find a clue on the real culprit? A week has already passed you know.”

“We are trying our best without—” Walter got cut off.

“Do you want us to sow chaos in the student body? Let them all know that one of their fellow students died? This method of speaking to each and every suspect is the most optimal way to both keep the situation discreet while finding a new clue. Or what. Do you have a better method?”

“I do not.”

“Then I would prefer you be silent.”

Taking his arm in front of him, Eric bent his upper body towards him. “Then please excuse me, your Highness.” It was a servant’s bow. Only this time the servant stared straight into their master’s eyes.

Hylon found the gesture quite amusing. It wasn’t an everyday thing to go against a commoner, and definitely not while he was doing his work. Eric stopped halfway out the door before saying one last line: “She’s innocent and you know it. Stop dragging it out.” Anger, concern and a little bit of guilt were sensed in his voice and face. Hylon might need to reevaluate what he knew about him.

“Uh, your friend is quite something, Esther,” said Walter.

“I’m sorry for his stupidity, your Highness.”

“I don’t mind, this place needs people like him.”

A new student entered and answered his questions. And then another student, and another. The page of names were slowly but surely being filled with lines instead of names until a particular name was next.

“Siegfried, how is the royal Academy? Aside from the, you know.” Hylon circled his right cheek with a finger.

“O-oh, everything has been fine.” He looked a little embarrassed. “Pardon me, but may I ask a question?”

“Go ahead, I can even keep a secret for you if you want.”

He pointed to the seat two places to his left. “Why is she here?”

“Well, Esther is also a part of the student council,” said Walter.

“Right…”

“You seem to have a problem with me. Siegfried.”

“I just don’t see how she is fit to be in the student council is all. Average grades and frequently skipping classes, it’s not entirely suitable for a role model is it?”

“I didn’t know you saw up to me. Siegfried.”

“That’s not what I meant and stop saying my name like that.”

Like a meeting between a cat and a dog, Hylon observed the two of them without saying anything. Leaving the whole mediation part to his aide.

“Ha ha, let’s calm down you two. We haven’t even started with the survey yet. Your Highness, why don’t you start?” His aide blinked quite desperately at him. It looked absurd.

“Oh, I apologize your Highness, I forgot myself for a moment.”

“It’s fine, whatever is said in here won’t be able to leave. Now let me ask you, Siegfried. What did you eat on the morning of your duel?”

“Huh? What I ate? It was what everyone in the cafeteria ate.”

“And what was that?”

“It was carrot stew?”

Hylon motioned to Walter who gave a non-verbal signal of confirmation.

“Carrot stew is quite good isn’t it? The headmaster often praises the kitchen staff when we chat.”

“Well… it is tasty, but it’s not really what I like to eat.”

“And what do you like?”

“Uhm, its garlic mushrooms. The cafeteria has it on the Fridays.”

“Really? What a coincidence, that’s my favorite dish.”

Hylon got Siegfried to smile. “My friends always look at me like I’m some weirdo when I tell them, Ha ha.”

“They sound like some narrow-minded guys. Who doesn’t like mushrooms?”

Siegfried agreed and let out a chuckle.

“Your friends, who are they?”

He listed them. “Do you know them?”

“Of course, I know everyone in the academy. One of them is a Baron’s son, right? I met his father once in the palace.”

“I didn’t know that. We only got acquainted on the first day.”

“Wonderful, wonderful. It’s always pleasant to hear that you new student’s are doing well.” Hylon nodded. “Speaking of, I heard that you and Lucas didn’t really see eye to eye.”

“Lucas? I can’t say we did. Why are you talking about him, your Highness?”

“I just found it unfortunate that he had to drop out, so I thought of penning him a get well letter.”

“He had to drop out? I didn’t know that. I just saw him a week ago.”

“That was his last day here, the day of your duel. Did you know that?”

“No? I was too occupied with something else to notice.”

Hylon straightened his back. “Occupied with what?”

“I don’t really want to share…” His eyes went down to his left.

“It’s all right, Siegfried. You can tell us. Tell me. What were you occupied with after your duel?”

He turned to look at Esther for a second before coming back. “I…”

Hylon smiled at him, encouraging him.

“It didn’t really feel that pleasant to loose so I went to the church to cool off.” What? “Before I knew it, the day was already over.” Siegfried scratched the back of his head. “I know that the church is not a place to doze off, but I couldn’t help myself. I have always been a devout believer in the Goddess so whenever I felt angry or sad I would visit the church in my hometown.”

“I see.”

“It eventually ended up being a habit that I brought with me. And I swear that time was the only time I took a nap there.”

Estelle spoke up. “Siegfried. I think you misunderstood something. There is no rule that states you can’t take a nap there.”

“Oh. Really?” He smiled awkwardly. “I thought that was the real reason why I was called here.”

Finishing up their conversation, Siegfried left the room, leaving the members of the student council for themselves.

“Did what he said make you remember anything, Esther?”

She would just say ‘no, sorry again’, Walter had too much hope, thought Hylon. A whole day had passed and that phrase of hers were starting to get ingrained in his head. But it hadn’t all been a waste of time. There were some interesting parts in their body languages that he could investigate further. Perhaps even one of them today—

“I’m tired. Is it fine if I leave?”

“Yes it is, let us leave these two people to jabber.” Estelle escorted her cousin to the door. “So this is what you two have been doing everyday for the last week? What a waste of time.” The slam coming from the door didn’t hide her anger that well.

“She seems extra on edge today… Did you two talk it out after I left?”

“There wasn’t much talking to be done.”

“I don’t see what the problem is, your Highness. Something irreversible may happen if you don’t do something.”

“That won’t happen.”

“Looking at you two, I don’t know about that.”

He looked at his aide. “Since you are the expert in this field, what would you suggest I do?”

“Talk with her, Hylon.”

“I do.”

“With her, not at her. Tell me, what have you two talked about besides school or work?”

“You say that as if I’m some heartless man.”

“And you are not?”

“Enough about that. Give me the transcript.”

Taking the page from his hands, he met some resistance. Walter was acting childish and not letting go.

“I’m telling you this as your friend, even I find you to be insufferable sometimes. So imagining myself in her shoes, it’s no wonder why she is acting this way.”

“Don’t worry about that Walter. I wouldn’t fancy you even if you were a woman.” Hylon wrestled the page from his fingers.

“This isn’t a joking matter…”

“That’s enough. We have work to do.”

Adjusting his glasses, his aide asked what he meant.

“I need you to go confirm whether Siegfried really were at the church as he said.”

**Chapter 43: Midnight at the girl’s dormitory**
================================================

TK sneak into girl’s dormitory to find the witch, where they find lavenza doing the same. Changed the direction.

TK long chapter, at least 3k words plz

It was more pleasant than he thought, talking to the prince that is. Would it be a secret to say that he was his role-model? Top of his class, handsome to boot, and a beautiful lady as his fiance, albeit a little scary. He was the noblest of all nobles he had chanced to see; enrolling in the royal academy was the right choice after all. Aside from the few annoyances that seemed to follow him like a ghost.

First it was his test score. Seeing the posters that had his name listed only a little higher than the average, he wanted to tear them all down, if only there wasn’t such a huge crowd. Then when he decided to cheer himself up with something good to eat, a giant of a boy dashed smacked his tray away. His last bit of serenity rolled away like that piece of baked potato. It had to be Lucas of all people.

“Hey Sieg, what are you thinking about that you won’t even join our conversation.”

“He’s probably thinking about the meeting with the prince again. It’s no fair really.”

“Sorry, what were you two talking about?”

“Yeah, I want to meet with them too, the girls that is. Who do you fancy more, the Saintess or the Ice Queen?”

Siegfried blinked a few times. “Are you really talking about this again? One of them is going to be princess in the future, you know?”

“Tsk, Tsk. That is why this is the only time when we men can daydream. As they say, what happens in the academy, stays in the academy. Why do you think they even shoved all of us in this place to begin with.”

The other student sighed. “It’s obviously for us to better ourself and not think about ladies all the time.”

“Come on, we can’t be young forever you know? I will probably take over for my father after graduating. I need to enjoy myself when I still have time.”

“Is your father an executioner or something?”

The two students were bantering as usual and before he knew it, Siegfried said something he would rather not have said.

“I’ve actually been thinking about Esther lately.” Three pairs of shocked eyes lit up around their table.

“Siegfried, I really admire you, I really do. Especially after that heroic deed of losing a duel _and_ getting punched in the face. But I can not agree with you this time. You were thinking about _her_? The so called Ice Princess?”

His other friend spoke with a smug before he could defend himself. “As they say, hate only makes one love harder.”

“I wasn’t thinking about her in that sense.” Siegfried palmed his face.

“Speak up man. I know that her golden hair is quite lustrous and smooth, and her purple eyes are pretty and rare, but have you not seen how she acts?”

“Oddly specific traits you described there,” his smug friend said.

“She’s weird. Like, have you seen her gloves that she never takes off? I bet you she’s hiding something terrible.”

Siegfried lifted his head. “Please forget what I said… And I have enough on my plate lately anyway.”

“Yeah, like having a cozy chat with the prince.”

The boys finished up their lunch and prepared for the next class.

“So are we doing it tonight?”

Siegfried pondered for a second. “Do what?”

“He really didn’t listen did he?” He leaned in to whisper. “We are going to sneak into the girl’s dormitory.”

“What?!”

“Don’t try that hard to announce our plans will you?”

“Why and when did we agree to this?” This was beyond a simple prank.

“It’s not what you think it is. You know that story about the witch? We are going to catch her.”

“Why?”

The two other students looked at each other before turning back to Siegfried. “Because it sounds fun, of course.”

\*\*\*  
TK siegfried dream sequence

“Do you think it’s safe to go out?” Said the head above him.

“Even if it’s not, my legs can’t take any more of this cramped space.” Said another head below him.

“How did I even end up here?” Lamented Siegfried, while being squished by the two others.

The three of them were currently hiding in a closet, on the first floor, in the girl’s dormitory building. Running straight from the last class of the day, they arrived to this safe haven before anyone else. And there they sat and waited. Hearing high-pitched voices entering the entrance hall. Hearing light footsteps that always seemed to move in their direction and made them be stiller than a mouse. And at last, hearing the sound of silence as the night began to put the female students to sleep.

“All right, let me out!” In the process of opening the closet door, the boy above stretched his arm in such a way that made all of them lurch forward, resulting in them falling out with a satisfying plop on the now cold floor. Albeit a bit loud.

“Hey! Are you trying to announce or arrival or what?” Said the flat nosed student.

“Do you see this?” The droopy-eyed student pointed to his legs. “Look how much they are trembling!”

“As if I care about your legs in this moment!”

TK maybe add this part in prev chapter instead of keeping them undescribed.

Siegfried looked to his two so-called friends. The baron’s son looked like a newborn doe and the count’s son raised his voice as always. This was the first time, and likely not the last, that he thought he should hang out with other people besides them. But what’s done is done. They had succeeded in infiltrating the most off-limits place in the whole Academy. They would become legends among the male students after this.

“Stop bickering, do you two even know where this ‘witch’ is?”

Grabbing at each others collar, they told him that the destination was the fourth floor. Hardly a hard task, they had to just walk up the stairs, right?

“Hey, isn’t it too dark here? Shouldn’t the magic lamps light up?”

“I heard ladies can only sleep in when there is no light.”

“Who said that? Your mother?”

“No, yours.”

Siegfried took the lead in front while the two others acted as if they were on a sightseeing trip; commenting on every little thing that differed from their own dormitory.

These corridors were always filled with students doing their thing, filling it with excited voices while they jumped from topic to topic while plodding around, so seeing it now be occupied with only darkness and silence, Siegfried felt something scratch at the back of his mind.

The shadows coming from the painting frames appeared to move with him and that door over there? He was sure they had passed it a while ago. Turning around to look at the two behind him, they were still pointing at everything, as if it was normal. Using nothing but the shining full moon to lead them through the darkness, they ventured further and arrived at the bottom of the first stairwell. He must have seen it wrong.

With the help of the guardrails, Siegfried put dragged his foot on the first step. And then the second step. Then the third. Step after step, echo after echo from their shoes slapping the stair, they ascended. The second floor. On the the third floor, a voice coming from behind stopped him.

“Is it me or is it getting colder and colder?”

“Really? These stairs are killing me here.”

Siegfried turned to them. “Guys, its just one more floor. Hurry up and lets get this over with. It’s not even the weekend for crying out loud.” The floating moon indicated that it was beyond midnight at this point.

“Heh, are you getting scared, Sieg?”

“Stop talking nonsense and move your legs.”

“Strong denial you have there.”

“Why would I even be scared of something that obviously doesn’t—”

‘_Hahahahaha_’

“—exist…” He clammed up.

The boy complaining about the cold eeked out a question. “Uhm, did you guys hear that?”

“Holy. That made my hair stand up straight.”

“Quiet!” Was that the witch they were trying to find? She was actually real?

TK extend

Huddled together with their bodies together, the three of them took another step up the fourth floor. Step. Step. His heart began to drum in his ear.

“Hahahaha!” It was laughter. But nothing alike what he had ever heard before. A shrill voice reminiscent of a banshee’s cry, it contained neither an ounce of amusement nor mockery. The closest thing he could describe that laughter with was confusion. Like a question that didn’t have an answer, the laugh veiled around them and echoed in their ears. Asking what is was that was so funny.

Whispering a sound even more quiet than his breath, someone asked if this really was a good idea after all.

They couldn’t give up could they? Two more steps and it would be possible to peek at whoever it was that was laughing in the dead of night.

Almost kissing the stairs, Siegfried slid up the stairs bit by bit, inch by inch. The laughter was coming around the corner to his right. It was loud. It was carefree. Not feeling the want to stand up, he began to crawl. And so did the two others.

Crawling in the dead of night. Crawling in the girl’s dormitory building. Crawling on the witch’s fourth floor. They arrived at the corner. Footsteps, bare. That was the other sound Siegfried heard. The one that was laughing was bare feet, smacking their soles against the wooden floor.

His hair was the first to see the figure around the corner, then his eyes. White ankles peeked under the white nightgown that was without a hint of a crease. Golden hair that floated everywhere like a spider’s web. White arms that peeked under the sleeves that failed to hide their secret. In her bare hands, pressed against her face, was something that appeared to suck in all the surrounding light, and reflected it back at him. It was a knife.

Hunched over with her face hidden, the witch was laughing. Waving around the knife with abandon, each swing bringing with it a sharp cut through the air. It looked dangerous. Too dangerous for some boys silly enough to think it would be no trouble to apprehend the witch. They needed to, nay, he needed to turn around. Now. Before she saw him lurking around the corner.

Backpedaling on the floor, his shoe smashed into the face of the one behind him. Not expecting such a sudden impact to his already flat nose, he, afflicted with pain, forgot himself and inevitably let out a yell.

“Siegfried! What was that for!”

He was done for. “Get up! We have to run!” The witch’s hands stopped moving.

“What are you talking about, isn’t it just some girl fooling around?”

Siegfried was already on his feet, and without thinking about it twice, he ran. Leaving the two boys still lying on the floor. Whatever happened next would be of no concern to him. He had warned them and told them to run. He had done his duty. Two sets of screams echoed behind him as he quickened his pace.

Run, run, run. Siegfried ran down the stairs, almost falling when he misjudged where his foot would land. It was too dark to see. Would it be better to look down to his feet? Or would it be better to look behind him? The sounds following him were starting to catch up. Slaps, from a foot meeting the ground. Yells, from his friends he abandoned.

Down the first set of stairs. Now to turn to the left and down the next. And repeat this cycle once more. Yet contrary to his plans, there were no more stairs. A wall blocked his path, making him slam into it. Air escaped his lungs with a gasp.

Did he go in the wrong direction? How? This stairwell should have ended on the first floor. Right? There was no more time to think. The blood-curling shouts that had been on his back stopped.

“Damn it!”

There had to be another exit, he was sure of it. And so he ran. Down the pitch-black darkness, down the hall with nothing but wall on the sides. Nary a window nor a door, to his right or his left. Long and winding, the hall went on endlessly in front of him.

Something was wrong. Even in his panic, Siegfried knew that this hallway didn’t seem right. But a glowing light wiped all other thoughts he had. Yellow and warm, the window let in the hope that was outside. The sun had risen. Siegfried found himself standing in front of another stairwell that went downwards. Only this one had a tall figure blocking it.

“Out of the way!”

And so he pushed him.

He had been getting on his nerves since day one, and on this particularly hot day, when he lost the duel he challenged Eric to. He couldn’t take it anymore. Lucas, in his infinite wisdom, had sought after him after the humiliating loss, and to do what? To cheer him up. Laughable.

It was a good effort, he said. A good show. I would never be able to do something like that, he said, as if it were up to debate.

Like a rock rolling of a cliff, Siegfried stood and watched as the ridiculously tall boy flew down the stairs, bouncing and turning each time he met it.

“Huh?”

“Why did you do it?”

“I-I didn’t mean to…”

“You say that as if it is some simple thing. Like dust under the carpet. Is that how little you valued his life?”

“No! I told you I didn’t mean it! Something j-just took over me!”

“An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” Siegfried turned around to the voice preaching the unknown saying. “Fall, as he have.”

Something pierced into his chest, looking down he saw a handle sticking out. Then blood. Then the ceiling as he slipped off the top of the stairs. Is this how he would die? Killed by the witch? Golden hair framed her face that had the same expression as always. Neither frowning nor smiling. She watched as he fell down the stairs.

Then he woke up.

His clothes were soaked with sweat, the same with the bedsheets.

“Ha… It’s that same dream again…”

“…”

“Damn it!”

Work, or more work. One of those filled Hylon’s schedule, whether it be Monday morning or Sunday evening. Now, you may think that only because he shirks his duties, or pushes his duties to his aide whenever he has the chance, then it meant that he would definitely not be a workaholic. But the familiar knocking on the headmaster’s office would tell you otherwise. Like clockwork, he was here again.

“I pray you have good news, your Highness. His family finally accepted the monetary reward after we doubled it. To be paid for your child’s life, this is not what I started the academy for.”

The headmaster stood by the window, looking out at the wide courtyard that was filled again with students that preparing for their next class. Arms crossed behind his back, he talked without turning around. TKwrongpersonality

“Three more days and I will send His Majesty a message.”

“That won’t be necessary.” Hylon sat down on the couch facing the old wooden desk, letting out a deep breath that made his spine, in a rare occurrence, bend itself. “I have found the culprit. Send word to the capital guard instead.”

\*\*\*  
Estelle felt tired. Looking over at the empty chairs in the student council, she had to let out a sigh. How long had she been here? Not that it mattered, it was a responsibility she herself took upon herself when she joined. When she had to move the fourth stack of papers over to another desk, Estelle surmised she could take a little break for herself.

“Ha…” It was already the second time she sighed today, and more would follow if she didn’t do anything about it. But what? And why. Would it even matter to him.

She saw Phila slump over the table once. It was after she was finished with the first few papers on her first day. The newcomer must have been terribly tired to not care about her appearance. But it did look pleasant. So Estelle tried it, letting her cheek squish against the cool table.

The smooth surface looked bumpy from this position. Small imperfections that would in normal conditions be hidden to the naked eye. Estelle felt another sigh incoming, but the rapping coming from the door made her shoot upright before it could escape. She didn’t want him to see her behave in this slovenly manner.

“Uhm, Estelle?”

“What is it, Phila.”

“His Highness wants to speak with you…”

Estelle almost laughed. “So the lofty prince has begun using other people to move me around.”

She marched over to where the glasses-wearing girl stood nervously. Her collar had a loose thread hanging from it, a small imperfection that wouldn’t leave your mind if you witnessed it.

“Will you show me the way then?”

With Phila in the lead, trudging through the corridors, they ended up at the headmaster’s office. Everyone that was witness to Lucas’ death were already here, sitting in their respective seats. Even her cousin Esther, who appeared to no longer be confined; the bangle around her wrist was gone.

“Good, everyone is here now,” he said as if she were an afterthought.

Then, while the headmaster sat in silence, Hylon began sharing the results of his investigation that she heard for the first time. The most important detail was that the culprit had been identified. Wide eyes the size of dessert-plates filled her vision as he said who it was. Phila and Eric to her right, and Lavenza and Esther to her left. Estelle thought her cousin would be happier to hear the shocking news, as she were frowning instead.

“You’re absolutely certain that he was the one? I mean, he didn’t act all that different from how he was before.” Said Eric.

Even if they were technically enemies after all their feuding, hearing that someone you personally knew would be capable of doing such a thing looked to be a normal reaction. Alas, people were capable of more than you wished.

The aide was the next to speak. “Going through the details of that day again, certain discrepancies were spotted after cross-referencing it with the deluge of testimonies we newly acquired.”

“So when will you go catch him then.” Estelle turned to Hylon.

“The capital guards are on the way, so make sure to not raise any suspicion for the next two hours. And do not meet with Siegfried directly. Got it? Headmaster, I leave the details to you.”

“Close to seventy years have I lived. Tragedies I have witnessed far and between, but this one is all too different.” His voice rumbled. “In my own academy, in my home, how dare he target one of my own.” A murderous aura not befitting his gray appearance filled the room making Estelle’s breath hitch. It didn’t appear that Siegfried would be able to meet a peaceful end after this day.

Hylon left with Walter, leaving them to stew in the office as he decided that it was the safest place in the academy. If it was true or not, was to no concern to Estelle as she could rest for two full hours. Maybe even take a nap if there weren’t so many people beside her.

Tk small talk between the ensamble.

“Where are you going Esther?” Phila asked when she suddenly stood up.

“To the restroom.”

“Do you want me to accompany you?” Said Lavenza.

“It’s fine, you don’t need to do that anymore,” she showed off her arm, “doesn’t this mean I am a free person again?”

“I didn’t mean it like that…”

“I won’t take long. See you all in a bit.” The door closed with a soft thud.

“You are acting like her mother.” Estelle sipped her cup of tea that the headmaster had brewed for them. “Isn’t following her there a bit much?”

“I’m just a little concerned is all.”

“Concerned about what? All this will pass soon will it not?”

“Yes, and I am glad for that. But Esther seems to still be greatly affected by that day.”

“I knew it.” Eric added. “Of course she would.” He stood up, determination on his face.

“Don’t tell me you are thinking of following her to the restroom.”

“Something tells me that she won’t be there.”

“What do you mean?” Where else would she be.

“Lavenza, can I ask you to show where she would most likely be?” The air in the room shifted.

“You don’t even need to mention it.” The two of them marched for the door.

“Ha…” Her third sigh of the day made Estelle stand up too. So much for the two hour break.

“Wait, you guys! I’m coming too!” And Phila who didn’t want to be left behind, followed after them.

TK

Their group were quite a sight for the students mingling around the halls. The winner of the first duel of the year and the people-chosen saintess at the front, the top scorer in the middle and an otherwise plain student with glasses in the back.

Weaving through the onlookers, Eric ignored their greetings and marched forward with certain steps. What was is that affected him this way? Estelle followed them and they arrived at the open part of the floor where if you leaned over the railing, it would be possible to see all the way through to the first floor. The nearest restroom was to the right of this area and Lavenza left the group to go search for Esther.

Eric took this opportunity to scout the different floors as he appeared quite certain that she wouldn’t be in the restroom. He continued craning his neck like an owl until Lavenza came back, alone.

“She’s not there…”

Eric muttered to himself. “Esther, where are you?”

Then a booming voice came from the first floor. “Everyone! Due to certain circumstances, I need you all to come to the first floor!” It was Walter.

The students were agreeable enough to follow his instructions and did as ordered, standing in rows in front of him while he stood in front of the main entrance. Hastening their pace, they ran down the stairs to meet up with him.

“What is happening?” A student asked.

“Looks like the student council has an announcement to make?”

“Oh, is it about the academy ball?” TK remove

Excited murmurs flooded the room after that comment began spreading around.

Spotting them running, a confused Walter asked why they were here instead of the office. Eric replied saying that Esther were no where to be seen and if he had seen her.

“Walter, good job corralling the students.” Hylon entered the hall making the students go quiet and pay attention. “Why are all of you here? Maybe it will be better this way.”

Marching through the lined up students that parted away in his presence, he arrived at the stairs that with a few steps, you could look over the whole first floor.

With a voice full of confidence, the next words he said pierced through their minds. “Siegfried! Please step forward!” It was theatrical. He wasn’t thinking of denouncing him right here and now, would he?

Just uttering his name in this manner was enough to put him under scrutiny, let alone adding the fact that he was a murderer. Estelle debated whether this or an execution was worse while she waited with the others. Waiting for the culprit to step forward with his own free will. But nothing. No one spoke, let alone stepping up to the occasion.

Hylon shouted again, and this time a shout rang back, from behind him. All the way at the top of the stairs that connected to the third floor, stood two people. One of them had blue hair and the other had gold hair. It was the boy Hylon had tried to find and the missing girl they had been searching for.

Like a pair of star-crossed lovers, the sight of them captured the attention of everyone daring to watch, eliciting gasps from everyone around Estelle. Lavenza. Phila. The students that had just finished their classes, the students that thought had just eating dinner that she herself had skipped.

For he had pushed her. Off the stairs, with nothing to grab onto.

“Stay away from me!”

The stairs had a landing zone built between the first and second floor, giving the people using it a place to rest on their ascendance. It was a flat thing the size of three middle-sized beds or two of Estelle’s in her primary home. Two off-shoots of stairs a little smaller than the main slope sprouted to the left and right respectively. Following one of these would take you to the second floor where some classrooms stood empty.

Now, if you didn’t want to arrive at the second floor, you could instead keep planting your feet upwards to the third floor, because the stairs was built in this way. The architect didn’t like the look of stairwells or so it went, and opted to make one long stairwell instead. From the first floor to the third, it was only stairs. The architect didn’t care for potential accidents, nor did he take into account the what ifs when someone was sent flying off the top. They would surely die in the same manner as Lucas.

Eric was the first to move. He went quite far before Walter also sprang into action. Estelle calculated the distance, trajectory and time before her body would hit the ground. Then she stopped right before the last equation. The exact number didn’t matter. They would never be able to reach her fast enough.

But Estelle had forgotten in this little moment, who her fiance was, and what his magic was capable of. Bright like the sun, his hands began to glow. Esther reached the top of the second floor where the landing zone was. Then she began to sprout wings. Two white feathery wings that shone in the shade of the rainbow. Pair that with that girl’s hair and she looked to be an angel.

Flapping her new wings, it didn’t appear to do much.

“Esther!”

Tk extend even more

Which was why Hylon had conjured wings of his own. With more expertise and agility, he caught her in the air. Was it the sun peeking through the countless windows on the wall, or was it the magic that appeared from nowhere that made them shine? Estelle even imagined a halo above their heads. It was a grand sight for all to witness. The two angels embracing each other landed with a soft thud.

Amazement. Ecstasy. Wonder and awe. The students raised their voices for the prince and the girl.

Estelle should have been delighted too, delighted as Eric and Lavenza and Phila and Walter. That she was unharmed from that terrible fall. But she couldn’t. All her eyes could fell; all her heart see, was the prince and her fiance, hold her with such tenderness. One arm wrapped around her winged back, and the other under her dead legs. A princess-carry they called it. He was smiling too. Adding onto his already handsome face. What a gallant smile that was. Why, Estelle herself had never seen it.

A smile that didn’t contain a shred of responsibility.

Had she been deluding herself in her own fantasy?

**Chapter 45: All I see is me**
===============================

TK hylon speaking with the king

The royal palace, being the grand building it was, had an equally grand audience hall where merchants and aristocrats came to seek an audience with the King. A middle-aged man that haven’t lost his grandeur yet. Sitting on the throne with a relaxed posture, but still straighter than anyone, he came off as a upright person. Perhaps as evidence for this, the crown atop his head always shone and glinted in the the coming from the even-spaced chandeliers on the ceiling.

And when the allotted visitors were done for the day, the King moved inwards to his main office. A little smaller and less grand, it had a desk to sign off order, a couch to relax in, and a chair that didn’t look all that comfortable. Hylon sat on it once when he snuck in the office as a young lad. It was rough and wooden, no cushions to help his behind that had already adjusted to the soft chairs found elsewhere in the royal palace. He had asked his Majesty why this chair and not something else, to which the King answered: “You will understand when you get older.”

Sitting atop his table, acting like a paperweight, was the crown. For today, he had taken it off.

His hair, which you could describe as a mane, was open to the air to breathe in this rare moment. You would this his hair would have a round impression from wearing the crown all day, but focusing his eyes to observe, Hylon didn’t even see a wild strand of hair sticking out. Not even in his personal private office, where he would sign and stamp documents all evening, sat slumped with a sigh.

“You couldn’t handle the situation better than that, son?” He must be disappointed if he called him that.

“No one got hurt and the murderer confessed to his crimes.” The king let out another sigh. Two more and a new record would be achieved.

“A count’s daughter, who coincidentally is the granddaughter of the duke, almost suffered a tragedy by the hand of a viscount’s son. And not even that, the whole academy were witness to this I hear.” His majesty made a bridge with his hands that propped up his head. “And before all this happened, a student turned up dead?”

“He was killed.”

“Sickness, accident, or killed. You should have reported this to me at once.”

Hylon, standing straight like a pole, turned his eyes away from the King’s hair. “Given that this information didn’t reach you, I must have done a good job of covering it up. Sparing you the trouble of doing the same, didn’t I? Father.”

“And what a great cover up it was. I hear the count’s daughter still haven’t regained consciousness. Garius will without a doubt use this incident to ask for something ridiculous again.”

The sigh-record didn’t break today, only tying with it.

\*\*\*

I misjudged. I didn’t think he was so wary of me.

If only I had more time.

If only the prince didn’t find the answer before I could act.

Someone was holding my hand in this room that I could only call an infirmary. A familiar smell tickled my nose, a scent of herbs and medicine. A refreshing smell, albeit a little too pungent for me to appreciate first thing in the morning. Was it morning? Maybe it was night, the moon was peeking in from the window after all.

I looked down, half-expecting to see my mom sit there by my bedside, but I found Lavenza instead. Right. She had been keeping an eye on me ever since that day. Hovering around me as if I was some crazy person that didn’t know how to conduct herself. In her defense, my actions did warrant that type of reaction. I attributed it to sleepwalking because another answer would bring with it answers that I did not want to hear.

Lets see… I almost died again didn’t I? Tumbling down the stairs akin to Lucas, how lucky I was to leave unscathed. Broken boned I could live with, but what if my neck had snapped? Like a twig set in someone’s path, the best result would render me paralyzed for life and the worst, a meeting with the Goddess. I wonder if she would intervene if I really were about to die.

Did she hate me? Hate me for what I did and was about to do? Of course not, for she was the Goddess. Always looking down on me, with that smug grin. That stupid face didn’t seem capable of a human thing such as hate.

Lavenza was sleeping so I didn’t want to wake her up. Yet despite my best efforts to pry away my hand, her blue eyes blinked a few times under her sleepy eyelashes. She called my name and asked how I was feeling.

“I feel… well-rested.” My head seemed to have cleared up. No more fog and the buzzing was quiet now.

My choice of words sent a smile to her face. “That’s very good to hear.”

“How long was I passed out?”

“This is the third night.”

“Is that so?” Lavenza poured me a cup of water. I saw that my gloves were off when I reached for it.

“Do you want to wear them?” She pointed to where they laid on my nightstand.

I shook my head.

Using them all day for the last month, it felt weird not wearing them in the presence of others. My hands were naked, and I was no exhibitionist. The fabric slid effortlessly between my fingers when I rubbed it. And when I stopped, it laid limp as expected. Folding over my index finger and across my knuckles.

“I thought I lost them.” My next words made Lavenza’s face scrunch up.

“What happened after I was pushed?”

Lavenza began telling me everything that happened, sometimes pausing to see if I had any questions. The prince had positioned a small platoon of soldiers outside the building. The plan was to capture Siegfried when he would be alone with Hylon. It sounded idiotic. If he already knew who the culprit was, then all he needed to do was barge into his room at night. But I couldn’t fault him that much. The plan would be a success, albeit with a little theatrics if it weren’t for me.

I cut her off when she started to describe the angel wings that he conjured.

“How long did you watch over me? You can’t have been here everyday right?”

“Phila and I took turns. Eric and Walter wanted to visit but we shooed them off. Those boys should know better.” She crossed her arms.

“What do you mean?”

“A real gentleman lets a sleeping lady sleep. Especially when she is in her nightgown.” Peeking downwards I saw what she meant.

TK maybe remove light magic allergy subplot

Pulling off the blanket, I swung my legs off the edge to stand up. Lavenza asked if I needed help to walk to which I said no. The bathroom was only a little distance away in the infirmary, and there was something I wanted to check for myself.

Looking into the mirror in here, I didn’t know what I expected to see. But all I saw staring back was me.

Then I pulled off my gown to bare my back. And there it was, two oval burn marks. Right before I passed out, a burning sensation ran through my body, concentrated around my shoulder blades. I surmised this was the main cause for my unconsciousness.

“Lavenza, can you do something for me?”

“What is it?” She was straightening out the bed.

“Can you use healing magic on me?”

“I can… but I don’t think it will do anything for you.”

“I just want to check something.”

A golden circle hovered above my hands. The glow made it seem warm to the touch, but I felt nothing. It dissipated into dust and vanished.

“Thank you, Lavenza.”

I didn’t use that risky plan only to get branded in return.

\*\*\*  
I moved back into my old room the next morning. My side of the room was the same as it did before I was confined, on the contrary, Phila’s had a bunch of new things. Gathering that many things in only a week or so impressed me.

She had been studying on her cramped desk when I entered. Classes were cancelled in the aftermath of the incident. A whole week of of self-study were assigned to us students, from the first years all the way up to the fourth years. Phila told me that some were excited of their newfound free-time while others grumbled that they had nothing to do. She was surprisingly in the latter camp.

“You look much better, Esther,” she said.

And to that I said, “thank you.”

Then she smiled, having nothing else to say to me. But she did give me a letter. The sender was my mom.

I left the room and went to the student council to do something. Phila didn’t follow, opting instead to keep studying in her room.

“Esther! It’s good to see you.” Walter was the first and only one to greet me, because he was the sole person in the room.

“Where are the others?”

He told me that Estelle went back home for the sudden break, Hylon was at the royal palace, and Eric’s and Phila’s temporary post at the student council was done.

“How’s your health?” He smiled when I replied that I was healthy. “Make sure to not overexert yourself, pardon me, but you do look a little thinner.”

I brought a stack of papers to my desk. “Isn’t that a good thing.”

“Well, I do wish you would weigh a bit more.”

“And how would you know my weight? Lord Walter.”

He chuckled. “Someone had to bring you to the infirmary.”

Thinking about it, I assumed Hylon was the one to carry me.

I assumed Hylon was the one to carry me. Yet thinking about it, maybe it wasn’t prudent to assume that. Even if he did all that to save me, perhaps carrying me all the way would be too much. A prince carrying me for all to see? The thought made me shudder.

“Why didn’t Eric carry me.”

“Would you prefer that?”

“I just don’t think you should burden yourself with me. You already have your hands filled with all this beforehand.”

He adjusted his glasses. “It was no burden. You were quite light.” The sun made his face glow.

We chatted the rest of the day while we worked. The letters were quiet today and I finished my quota in no time.

A letter.

My parents were coming to visit. Not at the academy, but at my uncle’s. I was happy at first receiving the letter from my mom, but the single drop of dried liquid in the middle of the page made me choke up. Even when I wasn’t with her and a long distance away, she still cried for me. My father’s part in the letter mentioned the dagger he gave me. I wonder where I put it.

“… and that’s why he did that.”

“Sorry, who did what?”

“Did you doze off? Maybe we should finish up early today.”

And so we did. Walter opened the door for me and we went to the cafeteria to eat. I should have given it more thought before entering. Showing my face was all it took for everyone to stare and whisper.

“There she is. She does look like an angel doesn’t she?”

“Yeah, who was it that started with this silly nonsense about a witch? I should wring their neck.”

More words entered my ears, such as: jealousy, pretty and gold.

I turned to Walter. “I think I will skip dinner today, let’s eat together another time.”

“I didn’t expect it to be like this, I can bring you a portion if it’s too uncomfortable?”

“Thank you, but it’s fine.”

I left Walter and went to my room. Phila was gone somewhere so I thought I could get some sleep.

That night, I found where I hid my dagger. It wasn’t that hard to find as it was in the top drawer beneath my clothes. That night, when the clock struck midnight, I went over to Phila’s side of the room. She was sleeping soundly, letting out a low snore. I woke up when she entered some hours before, and one more time when she fell asleep. That night, I stabbed Phila in the neck with my unused dagger. She didn’t even notice as the golden circle stopped my efforts. I picked up my pillow and left the room.

“Lavenza? Can I sleep here tonight?”

A sleepy Lavenza let me in.

**Chapter 46: One week break**
==============================

It had been exactly six weeks since I last saw these academy gates and believe it or not, they looked the same. The carriage from the capital estate stood a little further away with its horse on stand by. It had brown fur with little dots of a lighter shade on its tummy. And waving me over by the horse was my personal maid, Melissa.

“My lady! It’s good to see you again!”

“Mel—” Her arms flew around me in a hug before I could answer.

“Look how tall you’ve gotten!”

My face poked out of her bosom. “Really? I don’t see the difference.”

She hummed. “You really have, about this much.” She indicated with her fingers a length of about a fingernail.

“That’s not much at all…”

Melissa took the luggage from my hand and joined me in the carriage.

“Have my parents arrived yet?”

“Her ladyship and lordship will be arriving this evening, are you excited?”

The corners on my mouth crept upwards. “Yeah, I am.”

The carriage rolled gently enough on the road towards the estate that peeked over the horizon after an hour or so. By the estate, I meant the high trees that decorated the gate surrounding the area. The main building was familiar, it looked the same as the one in the duchy only with the colors switched around. With darker colors such as black being the theme over there, this one in the capital had lighter airy color. Light blue walls with accents of gold on the windows.

We rolled to a stop and a young knight greeted me at the carriage door. “Good to meet you my lady, my name is Ramsey.”

The first thing I noticed about him was his well-combed hair. Parted into two halves, the forehead peeked forward with a confidence only seen in ambitious people. He had that kind of smile too. Teeth showing in his bent lips, not too much nor too little, just enough for the whiteness to show as if calculated. I knew how to make that smile too.

Ramsey’s eyes crinkled and reached out his hand with his palm up. “May I?”

“You may.” His arm was steadfast as I used it to let myself down to the ground.

Ramsay took the luggage that Melissa had started to hold and walked beside me as we made way to the estate. Taking shorter strides than his legs allowed, his gait matched mine.

“I assume this is your first time here?” He asked a head above me.

“It is. Is my uncle inside?” I wanted to thank him for letting me stay here.

“Unfortunately, he is out at the moment.”

“Then what about my aunt?”

“Her ladyship is with Lord Gilbert currently.” Both the patriarch and matriarch is out when they knew about my coming beforehand?

“I suppose my cousin is also with them.”

Ramsay smiled in reply. “Please do not think that they are gone on purpose. Something unexpected happened and they should be coming back by tomorrow.”

“A shame then, I wanted to introduce myself before my parents came.”

I haven’t heard much about my uncle. Only that he and my father didn’t have that good of a relation. Gilbert Nikodemus, the most likely person to inherit the duke’s title in a few years, was a man of little wants. Status, money and blood, he had everything a man could want. My father said that was why he could come across as an arrogant know-it-all. Not knowing about failure, his pride had never taken a hit.

Perhaps as evidence of his countless successes, the foyer and hallway to my guestroom were even more lavishly decorated than the Duke’s. Maybe even more than the royal palace. Paintings that covered the whole wall right wall, display cases holding objects ranging from exotic insects to sharp swords and axes. Standing beside these in even intervals were suits of armor adorned with the blue family crest.

The servants bowed their head to me as I walked through the museum and we arrived to my room. Ramsay placed my luggage by the door and bid farewell. Opening the door, the sight confused me a bit.

To compare my guest room to my bedroom in the duchy, that one was like a gilded teacup plastered with all sorts of embroidery on its porcelain made with the hands of the most expert craftsmen, while this one was the teacup you could buy as a set in a store down the road. It did its purpose as a vessel to hold boiling water but nothing more.

My room resemble a room that was meant for distant family, looking almost like a servant’s quarter. I chalked it up to a short notice and that unexpected thing Ramsey mentioned. At least they gave me a vase brimming with lavender that sat on my nightstand.

Melissa noticed them too. “I apologize my lady, I told them to not decorate the room with flowers but they seem to have forgotten… Let me remove them for you.”

The bed was soft enough, bouncing back when I poked it. “Melissa, are all the guestrooms like this?”

She went quiet.

“What about the room prepared for my parents.”

“That one does look better…”

“Is that right. I must be a real guest then.”

“My lady…” The flowers in her hand slumped.

“You don’t need to make such a face, this is far better than my room at the academy.” It only had a single bed after all. “Why don’t we chat over some tea? I want to hear how you have been faring without me ordering you around.”

She chuckled. “You say it as if I dislike being with you, my lady.”

Sitting down with Melissa, I listened as she told me about the things that she had done while working here. The routine here was more or less the same as it was in the duchy. With no lady to attend to all she did was, clean, more cleaning and a little bit of running errands to shake it up a bit.

“Do you want to guess how many bits and bobs we have to dust everyday?”

“How many?”

She sighed. “Far too many. It takes me a whole day to dust all of them on this floor.”

“It takes you a whole day?” She froze. “You do it alone?”

“It’s just a figure of speech! Why would I do it alone?” She laughed. “Oh, have you met her ladyship yet?”

“My aunt? I haven’t even met my uncle let alone her.”

“I think you would really like her. She’s really nice. Look she even gave me this for my work.” Melissa showed off a TK.

Well, it wasn’t really a surprise. Her portrait depicted her as a mild-mannered person. A roundish face with two soft-looking eyes affixed in a permanent smile. Her velvety green hair was tied in a bun similar to my grandmother but instead of giving the effect of gracefulness like the duchess, my aunt looked more easy to approach.

“Speaking off, I also have a gift for you.” I rummaged through my luggage to find one of the handkerchiefs I made.

“My lady, did you make this?” She held a cloth with a picture of a pudding embroidered on it. “It’s so well made…”

“Thank you for the compliment, but do you really need to tear up?” What a silly person.

With me present, Melissa’s duties were back to being my attendant. I told her to get some rest and she left me to do the same. I could take a nap and wait for dinner, except today’s refreshing sleep left me feeling energized enough to ignore such a thought. Leaving my room, I noticed people moving outside one of the windows.

They looked happy as they chatted with each other while doing their work. Ramsay was there too with some other knights. He managed to notice me staring at him and sent me a bow. With nothing else to do, I continued to stare at them. And they began wrestling for some reason.

With nothing but their pants and loose shirt, they grappled with each other. I didn’t notice it before but Ramsey’s muscles under his rolled up sleeves were quite large. The noise coming from them were quite boisterous as he continued to flip his opponents with leg sweeps, tackles and even some throws to make them fall on their backs. One after another until he was the last standing.

“What are you watching, my lady?” Melissa stood beside me before I noticed.

“Men.”

“Oh. Have you already come to that age?”

“I don’t know about that. What’s your opinion on them, Melissa? You must have gotten to know them this past month.”

  

  

  

“Hmm. I don’t know. What do you think about them, Melissa?”

“You can definitely find someone better.”

“That’s quite harsh coming from you.”

“

  

  

  

With me present, Melissa’s duties were back to being my attendant. I told her to get some rest and she left, leaving me to do the same. So much happened these last weeks, both for her and I. Staring out the window, some servants were strolling in the courtyard round back.

They looked happy enough as they chatted with each other. Ramsay was there too with some other knights. He managed to notice me somehow and sent me a bow. I continued to stare at the people in the courtyard until Melissa knocked on my door to announce that dinner was ready.

It was already past evening at this point and still no sign of my parents. Sitting alone at the enormous dinner table, the maids served me dish after dish. I had no complaints about their professionalism as they did their work. But the food was bland. Lukewarm too. Ridiculous. Did their oven break or something?

“Can you ask the kitchen to make this a little hotter?”

A maid took my plate with a smile. “Certainly, I apologize for the trouble. Our oven must have gotten broken, you see.”

“I don’t recall asking about the oven.”

“Again, I apologize.”

It took a full beat before she started to move again. And when she came back with my reheated plate, the contents in my stomach had already been digested. Dissolved in the acid, leaving only a slush of what was once food.

I finished up the meal and went to a lounge with a view of the front gate. Any signs of a rolling carriage entering would enter my eyes first. Melissa brought some refreshments and joined me for tea while I waited. However, nothing moved out of the window. Not a person, not an animal, and certainly not a carriage with my parents in it.

I sipped the last drop of tea. “Are you sure they would come this evening?”

“That was what the butler told me… I even readied the guestroom.”

“The butler, huh? Can you bring him here for me.”

Maybe they were being delayed by something. A broken wheel perhaps, or a blocked off road. An elderly man entered the room I sat in. He had a monocle over his right eye.

“You called for me, my lady?”

“Do you know the whereabouts of my parents? I heard they would be arriving this evening and as you can see, it’s already night.”

He rubbed his hands. “This evening? But they are coming tomorrow morning?”

“My maid told me something else.”

“Then she must have heard wrong,” he adjusted his single spectacle, “or simply be mistaken. I told her they were coming next morning.”

“Understood, that’ll be all.”

“Don’t hesitate to call for me again. Your well-being is at upmost importance to us.” He bowed and left.

Melissa apologized to me and said that she must have misremembered the time. “You don’t need to apologize. What’s to wait for half a day more? Cheer up all right?”

The next day came and I ate breakfast alone. Then I ate lunch alone. It was only that evening that a carriage rolled through the entrance. And it wasn’t even my parents. The crest on the outside was expectantly not ours as we didn’t have a residence yet, instead using the Nikodemus crest of the rose. Only this time it was blue instead of the familiar black.

It was my cousin, Noel who exited the carriage when it came to a stop. The same person I encountered while Lavenza was on her trip. Nothing about him appeared to change since last year as he sat across from me with tea and refreshments between us.

“It’s been a while, Noel. Let me apologize for not knowing who you were when we first met,” I said.

“Then that makes two of us. Imagine my shock when I found out I had another cousin.”

“You seemed to remember my father that time. Why didn’t you say anything.”

He put down his cup. “I think it’d be best I don’t tell you.”

I didn’t say anything to that.

“I heard you joined the student council in your first year. That’s impressive.”

  

  

That’s impressive, did you meet with Estelle?”

“I met the prince too.”

“

  

  

  

He put down his cup.

  

“How’s Lavenza doing.”

“She’s doing well.”

“That’s good to hear.” He smiled a little.

**Chapter 47:**

TODO:

TK add that the royal family is blessed by the goddess herself. This doesnt make sense, when the saintess is a thing.

TK have a scene another scene with the headmaster or smt, where the staff asks if it’s alright to give the prince the responsibility.

“Are you sure about this?” Asked the headmaster.

TK don’t make eric mention siegfried, just that esther should join them

TK change damaged hand to right hand, set up a detective scene using it. Redundtant, in this book, maybe.

TK mention pills (chap 37 backwards). make them have a purpose and make esther forget to take them. “I didn’t feel that sick. Maybe I could skip on these pills.” Maybe. Feels a bit contrived and out of nowhere.

TK foreshadow the word witch, maybe in the play in book 1. The witch of the academy or smt

TK mention the magic cuffs while expoing about magic research

Tk foreshadow duke himmel’s daughter and maybe saintess

TK have the prince play around with his magic while loitering in the student council. maybe he jumps out of the window or smt.
